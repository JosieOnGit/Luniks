# Temporary drafts
This file solely exists to prevent merge conflicts from happening in [[Story Drafts]], or any of the applicable stories that the drafts take place in. Additionally, this file is used as a draft board for topics or parts I want to develop later on in the story, and may give a tease as to what's to come next.

## Maria Quotes Post-RM
### 2096, after a lecture in Pahlatán
*"Is your eyesight worsening, Dr. Limáida?"* \
**"Hm..?"** \
*"I saw you struggle reading what was on the main screen, just wondering, since you do have glasses."* \
**"(Sigh) I suppose I am.."** She sighed back. **"Maybe I need to walk past Némiskéi and have my eyes checked again, it's been a while since I was prescribed these glasses, after all.."** \
And so she did, but before doing so, a quick glance in the mirror at home already gave her enough answer as to why her eyes weren't working along the way she had always known them for. \
**"They're discoloured.."** She sighed to her own reflection, and brushing away a strand of her to uncover her left eye, not only were some of the strands grey, but so were her palms turning a faint, light purple, spreading all the way from the patterns surrounding the halo on her back. Closing her eyes for a brief moment, she inhaled deeply, and reopening them once more, she faced her reflection yet again, focused on her eyes, revealing the blue discolouration in her vivid green irises better than before. A slight smile appeared on her face, a mixture of regret yet acceptance in her eyes. **"Fate's catching up on me.."**

## Lore crumbs for Maria
Potential additions that can help shape out the story of Maria, and her connection with the **Voyage**, her role as the **Cosmic Weaver** and its effects, as well as other everyday snippets that might see an insertion in *Memory Shards*. These include:
- "Diary" (*Memory Shards*) entries of Maria watching the purple pattern and markings on her back fade (**2078**->**2086**) and reappear from the development of the Golden Bow (100) onwards (**2089**) and worsening during the construction of the ARC (**2092**-**2094**(-**2096**)), reaching peaks around Routine Maintenance (**2096**). The reason should be that her *"fated death"* should approach soon (**2100**\* *// Subject to exploration and development*). Most likely written before/after her taken showers.
- Entry (*Memory Shard*) in 21XX where Maria either fabricates or stumbles upon a reflection or instance of Raléi in the *Endless Sea*. Highlights should be that Maria still gets emotional during this, which Raléi picks up and teases her about, while also remarking that her hair has gotten longer over time (*Shoulder-length*->*S. Blade-length*).
- Maria's employee number within Carbine changed from 000078 to 1, or 100, since **2087**. A small *Memory Shard* should highlight this as she looks to enter a "members-only" or "staff-only" area for a (gala?) of Carbine.
- Since re-entering work under Carbine after the *Spider's Web* incident during her **2073** internship, Maria had been given "Employee number 000078" since the doors in Pahlatlán and Némiskéi opened in around **2075**-**2076**. From this point onwards, she was a **Class 09** Aeronautical Researcher. Her developments during the following five years promoted her to **Class 07** and **Class 03**, respectively, before ultimately receiving the title of **Class 01** Researcher within Carbine Industries together with *Thomas Vanhuyt* and *Patrik Miyidkov*, the former having parted ways with Carbine in **2096**, the latter having parted ways with Carbine in **2092**. 
- **!! March 2025 note:** Maria's *Leremkov* infection/attributes have been put in **limbo**. As the dates for when this "infection" happened continuously changed during the process of writing and shaping up proper lore and writing for Maria, the role of **Cosmic Weaver**, the **Voyage**, and everything related to these points quickly outshined the importance or relevance of her originally-drafted Leremkov (Feline) attributes. Over time, this will be looked back upon and retroactively changed in existing stories, such as **Spider's Web**, **Misc entries**, and **Routine Maintenance**.
- Currently written is Maria's involvement in *Hammerhead Industries* between 2076-2080. This too has been placed in **limbo**, and is subject to many alterations. The only surviving parts of these original drafts from Maria's role within Hammerhead, is her involvement in the retrofitting and restoration of the **Hammerhead Satellite Ship** around **2080**, as well as her role in *Láizhe*, where she was the leading voice for the *Global Naming Convention Overhaul* in **2079**, cycling out "automated" or "generated" names (Like *Cintura* being named Messier-48, and its planets accordingly, Messier-48-OP-1 (*Oceana*)) for authentic names, such as those in the Choreos and Sol system. Much more than this, however, she will **not** be involved in, and as a result, *Patrik Miyidkov* is also "poached" or signed by Carbine Industries following the restoration of the **HSS**. The **HSS** restoration program was carried out by Carbine, following the offer from Hammerhead for "any industry" to retrofit this decade-old spaceship.
- (**!! Being implemented**) With the shuffle of data, there's a chance that Maria's date of birth may be shifted **two years backwards** to properly adjust for this timeline. It would then become *August 17th, 2052*, making her aged **43** during the events of *Routine Maintenance*.
- *// Notes for Echoed Immersion* | For Maria, it's not a matter of *if*, but *when* she will embrace her destiny, her fate. It's written in the stars that she will become the Cosmic Weaver aboard the Voyage, but it's her decision *when* she will embrace this. The only decision she can make is to delay it, until fate itself will wrap its arms around her forcefully. *// Which might happen in the year 2100. Could the Golden Bow play a part in this? Will she carry the Golden Bow away from the ARC, into desolate space, and become one with the cosmos?*

## Memory Shards / Internal Channels
### E-mail to Patrik Miyidkov (2077)
Patti, it's urgent.

I don't understand what it is they're doing internally within Hammerhead. Month after month they delay existing projects in favour of those of their own interest. VOID is something that always stands on top of the endless piles, and despite no progress being made, it remains up top. Both you and I have worked on VOID and we have worked together with Thomas to retrofit the HSS, and now they're pushing the re-launch forwards despite never having suited a proper pressure test. It's bound to go wrong, but their priority shifts to VOID each and every time.

I'm making my full-time return to Carbine in 2078. While I appreciated Owen's gesture and offer to stay at Hammerhead for the foreseeable future, it simply conflicts with how my projects have worked in the past years. I will forwards this to Thomas, too, and attempt to convince him to make a return to Pahlatlán either at the same time as me, or at a later stage when the Campus fully returns to life. I will leave the HSS for what it is and no longer bother with security checks, Hammerhead ignores these anyway, it will be wasted energy. I will leave Shánzhe and stay in Láizhe to get the naming conventions for Stellar systems changed, and after that point I will return to Pahlatlán. Don't bother informing Qileng about this, it's not like he cares enough about his research staff anyway.

Maybe we'll see each other again before I return to Pahlatlán, but in case I don't, I hope I'll be able to see you again working under Carbine, away from the hellish landscape of Hammerhead. 

I'll keep in touch, Patti,
Maria Limáida

- **GRIDRUNNER** | An **interjection** or **mini-story** of two gridrunners utilising evolved **Neurotech** technology to deploy hacks by virtually yet physically travelling through the wiring networks might find its way into the grand scheme of **Gridrunner** as a whole and might shine a light on the variety of the term "Gridrunner".

## Leremkov - PENDULUM (shelved)
*// This draft is **shelved**, and may not be implemented any time soon, if at all.* \
Self insert into pendulum - Receive aid and care through Vienna & Olen.

## Ghost Temples - Repurposing of Masks
As more characters came into play with Ghost Temples, the necessity of masks came down as a result. So far, only **Luna** and **Snow** have received a mask for a specific reason, but every character since has not been given a mask that represented them as a person. 

Because of this, I believe it's fine to keep the masks as they are, but repurpose them into a *vanity project* for the characters themselves. **Luna** preferred to keep their identity hidden from the masses with fears of being spotted, and for **Snow**, it's a means to pursue her dreams of becoming a versatile artist from before she had died. 

For **Temple Guardians**, the masks will remain the same, and will also remain a tradition. The *plain white mask*, which has made an appearance plenty of times, will remain as tradition for **Rebirths**, and Marten will continue to wear his unique *half-mask* that only covers his face below his eyes. With this, I believe that I can lessen the pressure on coming up with specific and forced masks and character details that I don't believe really fit the characters, and might steer the project into a direction that's far too niche and not aligned with what I truly aim for.
## TRAVEL RISK - Nova Character 
Nova will be recruited into an Agency after having undergone military training and service in Eastern Kérisant, partaking in the **Mharáni unrest**, and is originally from **Strava Mikkë**.
### Drafted Story - REFRESH
A story encompassing Nova's first mission after reaching Zakh'háfo, and her first contact with The Agency and Vátnelári. In this mission, she receives the simple task of deceiving a dealer that ran away from Vátnelári, and is hiding in various bars throughout the days to stay out of sight, and to prevent getting himself killed. Nova enters the bar and tries to get in touch with him, offering a more personal conversation while not ticking him off, and gets in contact with the bartender as well in order to spike his drink with a drug that should be lethal for him during the night. Uses quote **"You're adorable. It's a shame I have to kill you."** On the way out after successfully drugging and thus killing this dealer, she stumbles upon Nils in the exit, and then engage in a small talk that leads to Nova defecting to **The Agency**.
## TRAVEL RISK - What Remains 
Straying away from the primary focus on Lúniks, **What Remains** should focus on where **INTERIM** takes place as well. Chronologically, this story, or collection of stories, should take place around the same time as [[HEAD TO HEAD - Story]], while not laying further focus on either **Mika** or **Gradient** specifically. 

After the *Attempted Territorial Expansion* of **Illinois** in **2062**, **Martin Palmer** goes into hiding and continues his progress on the **Ultima** project. In that same time, **Hammerhead** and **Southern States** spies make their way into Illinois, and uncover the secrets that Palmer had left behind.
### Draft
In **2062**, after almost three decades of quietness in **Illinois**, the ruling government controlled by **PALMER-EDEN** attempts to annex the states of **Iowa** and **Minnesota**, which had been in the **Central American** region. This attack was retaliated by support from **Canada** and the **Southern States**, and as a result, Illinois collapsed and closed its borders from the public.

After the closure of its borders, Illinois stayed quiet while **Martin Palmer**, the CEO of **PALMER-EDEN**, now laid his eyes purely on his **Ultima** project.
### Of What Remains - Story
Story taking place in late 2075, laying the focus on the disparity between the now-flourishing **Southern States** and the closed-off nation of **Illinois** after its collapse from the attempted expansion and annexation of Minnesota and Iowa. 
### What Once Was
Story focusing on **Illinois** in late 2075, and the development and struggles that now grow more broadly within her borders during the increased development of **Ultima** and the **Palmer-Eden Tower**.
### NO FURTHER
Story that lays its eyes on the *Attempted Annexation* of Minnesota and Iowa in **2062**, which was immediately retaliated by **Canada** and the **Southern States**, who then immediately afterwards kept tight border control in order to prevent another attempt at expansion from happening. This story will focus on the development of this attempted expansion, its immediate shutdown, and the followup after.

**Context**: While the **Northeastern States** joined **Canada** upon the [[Collapse of United States]], and **Illinois** formed as well as the **Southern States**, every other coastal state was quick to join another alliance to keep itself from crumbling even further into despair. However, for the more central US states, no such thing was possible, and the states in question were quick to bleed out and enter a freefall in their population, all while **PALMER-EDEN** continued to attempt to regain its original borders. In the end, the central states remained what they were, independent states without a proper government, that was held together by a mere few strings. In **2062**, PALMER-EDEN's Illinois realised this, and in the two years prior, it had planned an all-out assault in order to overwhelm and annex the poorly-governed states to its west, **Minnesota** and **Illinois**.
