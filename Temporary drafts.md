# February 26th Drafts (2025)
## Maria (Alter) x Umbrella spinoff
It had been forever since her feet had touched the soil of the planet. Time had lost all meaning as it flew by for her, her luminescent hands exhausted from the continuous weaving of fabric, her ears deaf from all the voices she had listened to after all this time. She hadn't been alone, continuous company from Polaris and Nora reminded her that even in the void of it all, there were more people that listened to her. Even if they didn't carry the weight of the universe on their shoulders like she herself did, their burden wasn't entirely absent either. Polaris remained the Archiver, Nora remained the Keeper of Death, and Maria remained the Cosmic Weaver. Forever present, forever prominent in the cosmos. \
**"Worn."** She simply muttered under her breath as her first few steps on the turmoiled grass were careful, her dress soon following and brushing on the sprouts of grass, her halo idly levitating behind her. The sea of golden threads evaporated behind her as she approached the figure that stood before her. Crystals surrounded the majority of his limbs, and the umbrella-like item he was holding was pinned into the damp soil beside him. Indeed, he seemed worn out. She squinted her eyes, a distant but warm smile on her face as she stood behind the figure to his left, her luminescent purple hands held idle at her waist as their iridescence spread all the way up her arms to her shoulders, an intricate pattern ending at her shoulder blades, surrounding a mark on her back that was identical to the teardrop-shaped halo levitating behind her back. **"I've seen and felt the disruptions."** She began, smiling wider as she blinked slowly, continuously staring at the figure's back. **"What battle did you orchestrate here?"** \
The man turned around, grabbing the umbrella he had used to fight, with it crystallising almost immediately and giving off a purple glow. *“…I believe you’d call him friend. If higher beings call each other something like that.“* His expression was neutral, emotionless as he muttered those words. As if all the life was sucked from him. *“I looked up to him. I could’ve never hoped to beat him. And now that I fought against him… I knew that the Connector wasn’t the man I originally had looked up to.“* \
Maria smiled distantly, and shook her head slowly as she once more blinked slowly, taking another step closer to the crystallising man before her. **"Don't take me for a God."** She smiled innocently, the strings revolving and curling around her arms proving otherwise, but even so, she insisted for the lack of honorifics. **"We may have known a different Connector in our lifetimes. I have not had the chance to speak to him often."** She continued, the smile remaining on her face as her bright purple hand rested on the figure's shoulder, offering him a sense of comfort in whatever way possible while the golden sparkles now froze in place around her hand. **"Say, Umbrella, what was Nevo like before his Ascension?"** \
*“A simple yet strong man, a swordsman like nearly no other. I only knew one man that could hold a candle to him.“* Umbrella brushed off Maria‘s hand as he walked forward, looking up into the sky as the first raindrops started trickling down from the dark clouds above, slowly starting to soak him. *“You’ve talked to him more than you might’ve thought, Maria.“* Umbrella smiled as he turned his head back slightly, suddenly mentioning her by name. Purple liquid started to run down his cheeks from his eyes that gave off an even more violent purple glow than the crystals on his body or on his weapon, making it look like Umbrella was crying. *“We were good friends. Udyr helped him find his humanity, even if he was a robot. It was a shame that he gave up this new-found humanity just to save us all, even though I know he did the right thing.“* He looked up to the sky once more. *“He might’ve been defeated by me just now, but I know for a fact he isn’t dead. And I know he’ll come back to tell me I did a good job.“* Sighing, he shook his head and stuck his umbrella down into the soil again. \
**"As the Connector, he oversees and controls multiple realities at once, maintaining their interwoven connection between each and every one of them, and maintaining their balance."** Maria smiled back, watching the crystallised, weaponised umbrella he pulled from the soil be pushed back into it once more with gentle force. **"It's beyond my grasp, as impossible as that may sound."** She began, holding out her hand as fabric from the sky formed and lingered above her hand. **"It's been woven, its cries have been heard, and its pleas have been answered by natural means."** With her smile widening, the fabric levitated above her bright purple hand, and even though Umbrella couldn't decipher what story the fabric told, it was still enough to create a reaction on his crystallised face. The sparkles continued to swirl around her hands, and as the rain continued to pour down, puddles formed into the grass beneath them, reflecting the purple glow of her halo and the glow of his shimmering liquid. **"But as the Connector, I'm sure another version of himself has already made his way here. It's only a matter of time."** \
*“Of course. He’s obviously got a big task at hand with being the connector.“* Umbrella turned around and walked towards Maria, leaving his weapon in the soil. *“If you get the time, talk to him. Please make sure that he doesn’t forget, at heart, he’s still Nevo.“* Umbrella reached towards the fabric and weirdly enough managed to grab ahold of it, crystallising it. *“Show him those strings as well. We’ve got plans to turn this ship back around.“* He smiled as he gave Maria a pat on the shoulder and walked past her. *“We’ll bring Nevo back and defeat fate. If we can get him to merge all these realities into one and defeat Crono just once, all is well.“* He chuckled at his own words, putting a hand on his forehead. *"Man, I sound crazy with the things we plan to achieve… But I guess we’ll do anything to bring back an old friend.“* \
Maria smiled, her eyes closing for a moment after she inspected the intricate patterns of the dark crystals that had formed on the fabric, forever marking it even after it had been forever completed. Nodding slowly, the halo behind her back shimmered as it continued to levitate freely in the air, anchored behind her back. Inhaling slowly and softly through her nose, the crystallised fabric began to levitate above her iridescent purple hands, their purple glow reflecting and shining on the crystals before it began to evaporate in the air, joining the endless sea of golden strings and woven fabric in the endless void in which she weaved all pleas there were to please. **"I'm confident I won't be there to watch you defeat Crono, for all I know, it may not even be this reality that it will be achieved in."** Maria smiled, before reopening her eyes and turning around to face Umbrella's back once more, the multicoloured iridescence in her eyes shimmering brightly as her hands returned to rest idle at her waist. **"But I will live along with that battle in your minds and hearts, and through the fabric will I learn the story, and through Polaris will I see it unfold."** Her smile widened as she continued to speak. **"Once Nevo, from whichever reality it may be, reunites with ours, I will present him the fabric."** She smiled warmly, the sparkles surrounding her hands intensifying as she stood steadfast in place in the soaking rain, seemingly unfazed and untouched by the water that was forming beneath her feet. After all, she stood above it, not a single piece of clothing touched by the water. **"The wind shall blow in your favour, Umbrella, whenever that shall be."**

## Maria (Alter) x Nevo spinoff
**"Torn fabric."** She sighed, holding a piece of fabric dearly in her hand. Their words had been cut off effortlessly, disrupting their story, disrupting their completion. The teardrop-shaped halo continued to shimmer in a deep purple as the fabric levitated above her luminescent hand that shared a similar colour to her halo. **"Once in harmony, now disrupted.."** \
Ripples formed beneath her feet as she turned around to face the bright green eyes of the only person she shared this void with. **"We share a similar role, do we not?"** \
*"I guess you could say so."* He said in response, his blade sheathed, but the iridescence of the blade not hidden, as its light bled from the sheath. \
**"As the Cosmic Weaver, I simply weave the fabric."** She smiled, her multicoloured eyes glimmering as the fabric in her hand was restored to its original form, increasing in size, increasing in length, and increasing in depth. Whatever story it was composed of before it was torn, it was now rewritten and woven back, and reunited with the universe in reality. \
**"And I simply reunite it with reality, as fate forever intends."** Her smile widened as her halo shimmered intensively as she handed the fabric over to Nevo, allowing him to hold and inspect it. \
**"Connector."** Her voice deepened slightly, her tone becoming more serious now that the fabric had been handed over to Nevo. Their gazes met once more, but Maria's smile had diminished while the glow in her eyes, hands, and halo had not. The ripples beneath their feet intensified, but were soon to settle down again as she rested her hands idle at her waist. \
**"Make sure it reaches the right reality."**

## Memory Shards / Internal Channels
### E-mail to Patrik Miyidkov (2077)
Patti, it's urgent.

I don't understand what it is they're doing internally within Hammerhead. Month after month they delay existing projects in favour of those of their own interest. VOID is something that always stands on top of the endless piles, and despite no progress being made, it remains up top. Both you and I have worked on VOID and we have worked together with Thomas to retrofit the HSS, and now they're pushing the re-launch forwards despite never having suited a proper pressure test. It's bound to go wrong, but their priority shifts to VOID each and every time.

I'm making my full-time return to Carbine in 2078. While I appreciated Owen's gesture and offer to stay at Hammerhead for the foreseeable future, it simply conflicts with how my projects have worked in the past years. I will forwards this to Thomas, too, and attempt to convince him to make a return to Pahlatlán either at the same time as me, or at a later stage when the Campus fully returns to life. I will leave the HSS for what it is and no longer bother with security checks, Hammerhead ignores these anyway, it will be wasted energy. I will leave Shánzhe and stay in Láizhe to get the naming conventions for Stellar systems changed, and after that point I will return to Pahlatlán. Don't bother informing Qileng about this, it's not like he cares enough about his research staff anyway.

Maybe we'll see each other again before I return to Pahlatlán, but in case I don't, I hope I'll be able to see you again working under Carbine, away from the hellish landscape of Hammerhead. 

I'll keep in touch, Patti,
Maria Limáida



# July 31st Drafts (2024)
- **GRIDRUNNER** | An **interjection** or **mini-story** of two gridrunners utilising evolved **Neurotech** technology to deploy hacks by virtually yet physically travelling through the wiring networks might find its way into the grand scheme of **Gridrunner** as a whole and might shine a light on the variety of the term "Gridrunner".

## Leremkov - PENDULUM (shelved)
*// This draft is **shelved**, and may not be implemented any time soon, if at all.* \
Self insert into pendulum - Receive aid and care through Vienna & Olen.

## Ghost Temples - Repurposing of Masks
As more characters came into play with Ghost Temples, the necessity of masks came down as a result. So far, only **Luna** and **Snow** have received a mask for a specific reason, but every character since has not been given a mask that represented them as a person. 

Because of this, I believe it's fine to keep the masks as they are, but repurpose them into a *vanity project* for the characters themselves. **Luna** preferred to keep their identity hidden from the masses with fears of being spotted, and for **Snow**, it's a means to pursue her dreams of becoming a versatile artist from before she had died. 

For **Temple Guardians**, the masks will remain the same, and will also remain a tradition. The *plain white mask*, which has made an appearance plenty of times, will remain as tradition for **Rebirths**, and Marten will continue to wear his unique *half-mask* that only covers his face below his eyes. With this, I believe that I can lessen the pressure on coming up with specific and forced masks and character details that I don't believe really fit the characters, and might steer the project into a direction that's far too niche and not aligned with what I truly aim for.
## TRAVEL RISK - Nova Character 
Nova will be recruited into an Agency after having undergone military training and service in Eastern Kérisant, partaking in the **Mharáni unrest**, and is originally from **Strava Mikkë**.
### Drafted Story - REFRESH
A story encompassing Nova's first mission after reaching Zakh'háfo, and her first contact with The Agency and Vátnelári. In this mission, she receives the simple task of deceiving a dealer that ran away from Vátnelári, and is hiding in various bars throughout the days to stay out of sight, and to prevent getting himself killed. Nova enters the bar and tries to get in touch with him, offering a more personal conversation while not ticking him off, and gets in contact with the bartender as well in order to spike his drink with a drug that should be lethal for him during the night. Uses quote **"You're adorable. It's a shame I have to kill you."** On the way out after successfully drugging and thus killing this dealer, she stumbles upon Nils in the exit, and then engage in a small talk that leads to Nova defecting to **The Agency**.
## TRAVEL RISK - What Remains 
Straying away from the primary focus on Lúniks, **What Remains** should focus on where **INTERIM** takes place as well. Chronologically, this story, or collection of stories, should take place around the same time as [[HEAD TO HEAD - Story]], while not laying further focus on either **Mika** or **Gradient** specifically. 

After the *Attempted Territorial Expansion* of **Illinois** in **2062**, **Martin Palmer** goes into hiding and continues his progress on the **Ultima** project. In that same time, **Hammerhead** and **Southern States** spies make their way into Illinois, and uncover the secrets that Palmer had left behind.
### Draft
In **2062**, after almost three decades of quietness in **Illinois**, the ruling government controlled by **PALMER-EDEN** attempts to annex the states of **Iowa** and **Minnesota**, which had been in the **Central American** region. This attack was retaliated by support from **Canada** and the **Southern States**, and as a result, Illinois collapsed and closed its borders from the public.

After the closure of its borders, Illinois stayed quiet while **Martin Palmer**, the CEO of **PALMER-EDEN**, now laid his eyes purely on his **Ultima** project.
### Of What Remains - Story
Story taking place in late 2075, laying the focus on the disparity between the now-flourishing **Southern States** and the closed-off nation of **Illinois** after its collapse from the attempted expansion and annexation of Minnesota and Iowa. 
### What Once Was
Story focusing on **Illinois** in late 2075, and the development and struggles that now grow more broadly within her borders during the increased development of **Ultima** and the **Palmer-Eden Tower**.
### NO FURTHER
Story that lays its eyes on the *Attempted Annexation* of Minnesota and Iowa in **2062**, which was immediately retaliated by **Canada** and the **Southern States**, who then immediately afterwards kept tight border control in order to prevent another attempt at expansion from happening. This story will focus on the development of this attempted expansion, its immediate shutdown, and the followup after.

**Context**: While the **Northeastern States** joined **Canada** upon the [[Collapse of United States]], and **Illinois** formed as well as the **Southern States**, every other coastal state was quick to join another alliance to keep itself from crumbling even further into despair. However, for the more central US states, no such thing was possible, and the states in question were quick to bleed out and enter a freefall in their population, all while **PALMER-EDEN** continued to attempt to regain its original borders. In the end, the central states remained what they were, independent states without a proper government, that was held together by a mere few strings. In **2062**, PALMER-EDEN's Illinois realised this, and in the two years prior, it had planned an all-out assault in order to overwhelm and annex the poorly-governed states to its west, **Minnesota** and **Illinois**.
