# Temporary drafts
This file solely exists to prevent merge conflicts from happening in [[Story Drafts]], or any of the applicable stories that the drafts take place in. Additionally, this file is used as a draft board for topics or parts I want to develop later on in the story, and may give a tease as to what's to come next.

# February 6th Drafts
## A passage of life (Keeper of Death teaser)  
It could be considered a part of a horror movie. A haunted mansion, kept my a grim reaper, granting a safe passage to all who intrude into the next realm. The walls had been coated in a deep, crimson red from all the blood that had been spilt, the wood bent in place from all the moisture it's soaked up. Streaks of blood on the floors, the walls, and curiously, the ceiling, too. Blood it spilled, yet stained, her scythe was not.  
  
The front doors creaked, and a single pair of footsteps could be heard walking throughout the mansion just outside the main hall.  
  
*// Inspired by the lyrics to SHADIENT - Ego Insomniac. "Multicoloured lights are leaking from your eyes." The idea is that the Keeper of Death, who will receive a name during writing, can "attain" or "mark" ("You were the inked mark") a certain person that trespass this peculiar mansion. A reason for this mansion being classified or referred to as the "blood mansion" is still in the works. An attained person will experience severe discomfort and nausea over time, akin to having been bitten by a venomous animal, which will begin to distort their vision. The lights, or their soul, will eventually literally "bleed" from their eyes, all the colour their souls once possessed feeding the mansion as its settler once intended. Eventually, their souls will simply be emptied and while drained, the attained person will struggle to walk out of the mansion to flee, or struggle to walk at all. With scythe drawn, Nora, the Keeper of Death simply adds a period at the end of the last sentence, completing the novel of the attained person's life. All light will have left their body, rainbow trails leaking from their eyes, facing the tip of the enormous blade now held before their chin. "This story ends here." She said, looking down at the attained person, who looked devoid of life. "For you'll continue your saga with Cziskvelén." Her scythe begins to emit a faint, rainbow glow, matching the iridescence of their tears, matching the rainbow iridescence in Nora's hair and eyes, as it moves to float besides their head. A simply strike puts an end to their first novel. Their second novel was now to begin at the hands of Cziskvelén.*  
  
Reoccurring themes within the Voyagers are:  
- Polaris: Glass/crystals (reflections)
- Maria: Fabric (weaving), dancing (strings)  
- Nora (Keeper of Death): Writing (literature)  
- Cziskvelén (Keeper of Life: Botany (flowers)  
  
Specifically for **Nora**, her colour scheme is quite the contrary to a usual grim reaper as depicted in horror movies and similar outings. She is often dressed in white, and while her hair is a mixture of black and white, her eyes are almost entirely chromatic and rainbow-coloured. Not just her eyes, but some strands in her hair follow that same chromatic and reflective rainbow colour in her eyes, as well as the sharp edge of her scythe's blade. \  
Lore wise, this is because she has a *direct connection* to **Chroma**. Where Cziskvelén is the Keeper of Life, he was only made aware of this title after his death, and afterwards, the Chroma granted him a way to grant those that have died another chance at life. \  
**Nora** in that regard has a direct connection with the Chroma. Those that trespass usually experience this during dreams while they're asleep. It's a metaphor for seeing one's memories flash before their eyes before they die, but as they're fast asleep, they can't do so. **Nora**, in this case, is just a *messenger* for those memories, before ultimately taking them away as they're set on entering *rebirth* through Cziskvelén.  

**"The lights are bleeding from your eyes."** She said in a dull tone, standing before the attained person who had fallen to their knees, the liquid seeping from their eyes into their hands as they stared in horror at their hands soon soaked by this liquid. *"Wh-what's.."* \  
**"It glows brightly."** She simply smirked. The hood over her head hid her eyes at a glance, but their light couldn't be hidden at it reflected against its inner fabric. The reflection was white, but the streaks of light were rainbow. **"Are you happy?"** \  
They remained confused, but looking up to face the voice, they could only see a woman now kneeling before them. Her clothes were a mixture of black and white, the hood over her head covered her face in shadows, and only her iridescent eyes could be seen. *"Am I..?"* they stammered, their eyes tracing the figure before them from head to toe, but upon reaching the floor, they recognised something they'd rather have not. Behind her knees was the blade of a scythe, eagerly waiting for action, eagerly waiting for blood. *"I'm.. mostly scared.."*

*// Introductory section to the character and Nora. Understandably, they're **very** afraid of the situation they're in, but Nora is willing to listen, and willing to tell them about their life they've lived. After all, they've essentially already died in their sleep, and Nora is simply there to perform the ritual and guide their spirit towards the Chroma and towards the Elevated Realm.* \
*// Nora is also a mediator in this sense. She understands the situation the attained person is finding themselves in, and also understands what she needs to do herself to calm them down. She does so successfully, and the two simply chat, laugh, and cry over all the various stories the attained person had gone through in their previous life. In the end, all life is mortal, even the Voyagers aren't immortal (Cziskvelén is nearing his death).* \
*// Nora's personality is still relatively in the drafts, because not enough writing exists just yet to determine the kind of person she is. Even so, she's a joyful person that laughs a lot, but not in a psychotic kind of way.* \
*// Nora's **COTVs** will mostly likely be told through the means of various chapters as if they were written in a book. As her theme is about writing and literature, the common opening (Like Polaris's "Days since her life-changing surgery" and Maria's "She meditated by herself" openings) will most likely be something akin to ink writing on a page.*



# July 31st Drafts (2024)
- **GRIDRUNNER** | An **interjection** or **mini-story** of two gridrunners utilising evolved **Neurotech** technology to deploy hacks by virtually yet physically travelling through the wiring networks might find its way into the grand scheme of **Gridrunner** as a whole and might shine a light on the variety of the term "Gridrunner".

## Leremkov - PENDULUM (shelved)
Self insert into pendulum - Receive aid and care through Vienna & Olen.

## Ghost Temples - Repurposing of Masks
As more characters came into play with Ghost Temples, the necessity of masks came down as a result. So far, only **Luna** and **Snow** have received a mask for a specific reason, but every character since has not been given a mask that represented them as a person. 

Because of this, I believe it's fine to keep the masks as they are, but repurpose them into a *vanity project* for the characters themselves. **Luna** preferred to keep their identity hidden from the masses with fears of being spotted, and for **Snow**, it's a means to pursue her dreams of becoming a versatile artist from before she had died. 

For **Temple Guardians**, the masks will remain the same, and will also remain a tradition. The *plain white mask*, which has made an appearance plenty of times, will remain as tradition for **Rebirths**, and Marten will continue to wear his unique *half-mask* that only covers his face below his eyes. With this, I believe that I can lessen the pressure on coming up with specific and forced masks and character details that I don't believe really fit the characters, and might steer the project into a direction that's far too niche and not aligned with what I truly aim for.
## TRAVEL RISK - Nova Character 
Nova will be recruited into an Agency after having undergone military training and service in Eastern Kérisant, partaking in the **Mharáni unrest**, and is originally from **Strava Mikkë**.
### Drafted Story - REFRESH
A story encompassing Nova's first mission after reaching Zakh'háfo, and her first contact with The Agency and Vátnelári. In this mission, she receives the simple task of deceiving a dealer that ran away from Vátnelári, and is hiding in various bars throughout the days to stay out of sight, and to prevent getting himself killed. Nova enters the bar and tries to get in touch with him, offering a more personal conversation while not ticking him off, and gets in contact with the bartender as well in order to spike his drink with a drug that should be lethal for him during the night. Uses quote **"You're adorable. It's a shame I have to kill you."** On the way out after successfully drugging and thus killing this dealer, she stumbles upon Nils in the exit, and then engage in a small talk that leads to Nova defecting to **The Agency**.
## TRAVEL RISK - What Remains 
Straying away from the primary focus on Lúniks, **What Remains** should focus on where **INTERIM** takes place as well. Chronologically, this story, or collection of stories, should take place around the same time as [[HEAD TO HEAD - Story]], while not laying further focus on either **Mika** or **Gradient** specifically. 

After the *Attempted Territorial Expansion* of **Illinois** in **2062**, **Martin Palmer** goes into hiding and continues his progress on the **Ultima** project. In that same time, **Hammerhead** and **Southern States** spies make their way into Illinois, and uncover the secrets that Palmer had left behind.
### Draft
In **2062**, after almost three decades of quietness in **Illinois**, the ruling government controlled by **PALMER-EDEN** attempts to annex the states of **Iowa** and **Minnesota**, which had been in the **Central American** region. This attack was retaliated by support from **Canada** and the **Southern States**, and as a result, Illinois collapsed and closed its borders from the public.

After the closure of its borders, Illinois stayed quiet while **Martin Palmer**, the CEO of **PALMER-EDEN**, now laid his eyes purely on his **Ultima** project.
### Of What Remains - Story
Story taking place in late 2075, laying the focus on the disparity between the now-flourishing **Southern States** and the closed-off nation of **Illinois** after its collapse from the attempted expansion and annexation of Minnesota and Iowa. 
### What Once Was
Story focusing on **Illinois** in late 2075, and the development and struggles that now grow more broadly within her borders during the increased development of **Ultima** and the **Palmer-Eden Tower**.
### NO FURTHER
Story that lays its eyes on the *Attempted Annexation* of Minnesota and Iowa in **2062**, which was immediately retaliated by **Canada** and the **Southern States**, who then immediately afterwards kept tight border control in order to prevent another attempt at expansion from happening. This story will focus on the development of this attempted expansion, its immediate shutdown, and the followup after.

**Context**: While the **Northeastern States** joined **Canada** upon the [[Collapse of United States]], and **Illinois** formed as well as the **Southern States**, every other coastal state was quick to join another alliance to keep itself from crumbling even further into despair. However, for the more central US states, no such thing was possible, and the states in question were quick to bleed out and enter a freefall in their population, all while **PALMER-EDEN** continued to attempt to regain its original borders. In the end, the central states remained what they were, independent states without a proper government, that was held together by a mere few strings. In **2062**, PALMER-EDEN's Illinois realised this, and in the two years prior, it had planned an all-out assault in order to overwhelm and annex the poorly-governed states to its west, **Minnesota** and **Illinois**.
