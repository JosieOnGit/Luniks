# Temporary drafts
This file solely exists to prevent merge conflicts from happening in [[Story Drafts]], or any of the applicable stories that the drafts take place in. Additionally, this file is used as a draft board for topics or parts I want to develop later on in the story, and may give a tease as to what's to come next.

## Polaris x ?? Spinoff/meeting
Since the last time that [[TEMP - Nevo x Polaris encounter]] had been written (In October 2024 for good measure), **Polaris**'s abilities have been further thought out and have evolved as a concept, one that now has more clarity and can be more easily integrated into alternative stories, either related to **SOLARdawn**, the **Voyage**, or a spinoff that is not related to existing writing. 

So what does Polaris possess, exactly? Her two eyes allow her two unique things: 
### Illusory (Left Eye)
This description is taken from the spinoff voicelines: \
*"My left eye? It's an iridescent, luminescent pink, and it allows me to illude whoever I look at. The wings in the corners of your eyes, brushing your cheeks and surely beginning to constrict your breathing? Do you see them, do you feel them? Congratulations, you've fallen for an illusion."*

Polaris's left eye contains an illusory power, that allows anyone she looks at (Including herself through a mirror) to be illuded through any means necessary. These can be anything, from illusions or hallucinations simply giving those affected a feeling of déjà vu, to unthinkable horror beyond anyone's thoughts. The key breakaway point for an illusion is usually the recognition of a faint pink glow in the far background, but the immersion is almost always too strong for the affected person to break this illusion. This ability is "powered" or "accelerated" by the six wings sprouting from the back of her head, which also allow her normal eyesight without the need to open her eyes.
### Retrograde (Right Eye)
This description is taken from her **Call of the Void (5)** sequence: \
*"It suddenly became clear, it suddenly made sense to her. The nightmares she's had every time she looked at an object before, she saw strange, rapid visions of strange people. The carpet at the main entrance revealed every person that ever walked over it, the curtains in the library showed her every cycle of the star and moon that it had witnessed. It weren't strange, randomised visions, they were authentic memories, genuine histories hidden in plain sight."*

Polaris's right eye contains an informing power, that allows her to see the history of any material, object, or person at will. First seen in the original Nevo x Polaris encounter, this is reflected by Polaris saying that she (paraphrased) **"Knows Nevo much better than he knows himself."**
### Using this, how exactly?
The story I had in mind was to start from the POV from one of your (Lucas's) OCs experiencing the illusion triggered or woven by Polaris, after which point Polaris herself begins to break the immersion by manifesting herself within that same illusion. Location-wise they're entirely within the confines of SOLARdawn in a controlled area, which means that nobody would be able to disturb the two. The illusion would soon become more akin to a memory, rather than a storytelling of horror, one that Polaris herself had gone through in the process of learning to control her powers. But this also gives room for development for characters by giving room to create a better background for the character in question (If it's Nevo for example, it can shine a light on *a* or *the* war that he was involved in).



# July 31st Drafts (2024)
- **GRIDRUNNER** | An **interjection** or **mini-story** of two gridrunners utilising evolved **Neurotech** technology to deploy hacks by virtually yet physically travelling through the wiring networks might find its way into the grand scheme of **Gridrunner** as a whole and might shine a light on the variety of the term "Gridrunner".

## Leremkov - PENDULUM (shelved)
*// This draft is **shelved**, and may not be implemented any time soon, if at all.* \
Self insert into pendulum - Receive aid and care through Vienna & Olen.

## Ghost Temples - Repurposing of Masks
As more characters came into play with Ghost Temples, the necessity of masks came down as a result. So far, only **Luna** and **Snow** have received a mask for a specific reason, but every character since has not been given a mask that represented them as a person. 

Because of this, I believe it's fine to keep the masks as they are, but repurpose them into a *vanity project* for the characters themselves. **Luna** preferred to keep their identity hidden from the masses with fears of being spotted, and for **Snow**, it's a means to pursue her dreams of becoming a versatile artist from before she had died. 

For **Temple Guardians**, the masks will remain the same, and will also remain a tradition. The *plain white mask*, which has made an appearance plenty of times, will remain as tradition for **Rebirths**, and Marten will continue to wear his unique *half-mask* that only covers his face below his eyes. With this, I believe that I can lessen the pressure on coming up with specific and forced masks and character details that I don't believe really fit the characters, and might steer the project into a direction that's far too niche and not aligned with what I truly aim for.
## TRAVEL RISK - Nova Character 
Nova will be recruited into an Agency after having undergone military training and service in Eastern Kérisant, partaking in the **Mharáni unrest**, and is originally from **Strava Mikkë**.
### Drafted Story - REFRESH
A story encompassing Nova's first mission after reaching Zakh'háfo, and her first contact with The Agency and Vátnelári. In this mission, she receives the simple task of deceiving a dealer that ran away from Vátnelári, and is hiding in various bars throughout the days to stay out of sight, and to prevent getting himself killed. Nova enters the bar and tries to get in touch with him, offering a more personal conversation while not ticking him off, and gets in contact with the bartender as well in order to spike his drink with a drug that should be lethal for him during the night. Uses quote **"You're adorable. It's a shame I have to kill you."** On the way out after successfully drugging and thus killing this dealer, she stumbles upon Nils in the exit, and then engage in a small talk that leads to Nova defecting to **The Agency**.
## TRAVEL RISK - What Remains 
Straying away from the primary focus on Lúniks, **What Remains** should focus on where **INTERIM** takes place as well. Chronologically, this story, or collection of stories, should take place around the same time as [[HEAD TO HEAD - Story]], while not laying further focus on either **Mika** or **Gradient** specifically. 

After the *Attempted Territorial Expansion* of **Illinois** in **2062**, **Martin Palmer** goes into hiding and continues his progress on the **Ultima** project. In that same time, **Hammerhead** and **Southern States** spies make their way into Illinois, and uncover the secrets that Palmer had left behind.
### Draft
In **2062**, after almost three decades of quietness in **Illinois**, the ruling government controlled by **PALMER-EDEN** attempts to annex the states of **Iowa** and **Minnesota**, which had been in the **Central American** region. This attack was retaliated by support from **Canada** and the **Southern States**, and as a result, Illinois collapsed and closed its borders from the public.

After the closure of its borders, Illinois stayed quiet while **Martin Palmer**, the CEO of **PALMER-EDEN**, now laid his eyes purely on his **Ultima** project.
### Of What Remains - Story
Story taking place in late 2075, laying the focus on the disparity between the now-flourishing **Southern States** and the closed-off nation of **Illinois** after its collapse from the attempted expansion and annexation of Minnesota and Iowa. 
### What Once Was
Story focusing on **Illinois** in late 2075, and the development and struggles that now grow more broadly within her borders during the increased development of **Ultima** and the **Palmer-Eden Tower**.
### NO FURTHER
Story that lays its eyes on the *Attempted Annexation* of Minnesota and Iowa in **2062**, which was immediately retaliated by **Canada** and the **Southern States**, who then immediately afterwards kept tight border control in order to prevent another attempt at expansion from happening. This story will focus on the development of this attempted expansion, its immediate shutdown, and the followup after.

**Context**: While the **Northeastern States** joined **Canada** upon the [[Collapse of United States]], and **Illinois** formed as well as the **Southern States**, every other coastal state was quick to join another alliance to keep itself from crumbling even further into despair. However, for the more central US states, no such thing was possible, and the states in question were quick to bleed out and enter a freefall in their population, all while **PALMER-EDEN** continued to attempt to regain its original borders. In the end, the central states remained what they were, independent states without a proper government, that was held together by a mere few strings. In **2062**, PALMER-EDEN's Illinois realised this, and in the two years prior, it had planned an all-out assault in order to overwhelm and annex the poorly-governed states to its west, **Minnesota** and **Illinois**.
