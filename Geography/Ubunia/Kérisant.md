# Kérisant
![[Flag_Kérisant.png]]

Kérisant lays in the southwest of Ubunia, sharing an enormous border with **Ellitróómi** and most of its tropical southern borders connect to Deónia. Behind **Thórirsant**, Kérisant is the biggest nation in terms of population across a generous number of cities and towns, with *Kérisant-Civem*, its capital, having the most inhabitants. 

Kérisant is home to many different sorts of climates, from tropical to desert climates in the south, to grass plains and dense forests in the north.
## Kérisant-Civem (Capital)
Literally meaning "Kérisant-City", Kérisant-Civem is the place to be for the most authentic cultural experiences in South-Ubunia. Deep within the city centre remains older architecture, having become obsolete soon after the first wave of the Luniksan revolution passed. However, even with the short-lasted construction revolution, some buildings still maintain this original style even far into the future, such as the *Kérisantic town hall*, and *Kérisant-Centrále*, the busiest railway station within the nation.
## Bilczat

*// Below is a drafted story written in 2021, but as described above under Nóve Osló, the description clashes with what is currently on the table and timeline, so in the final lore, this might not be the same as written below*
##### Lake Dnherá is located near Kérisant-Bilćat, which itself is near the capital of Kérisant

Lake Dnherá is located right in the very center of the Bilćat District in central Kérisant. It lays east to the Kérisant-Bilćat train station, as well as the storage warehouses for numerous transport firms throughout Kérisant.  

*"Lake Dnherá used to be visited by lots of different people, it was one of the most popular tourist attractions, after all. After the Collapse of Nóve-Osló in 2303, tourism collapsed along with it, leaving Lake Dnherá completely empty of visitors, yet this allowed the surrounding areas to flourish, giving life to new colours, lightening up Bilćat in ways never seen before."* 

One thing to note here, is that the supposed collapse of Nóve-Osló in 2303 causes a collapse in tourism as well surrounding Lake Dnherá. As the development progressed, the city of Nóve-Osló was moved to be located in Thórirsant instead, meaning that the two events cannot be a cause & affect of one another. This is noted down and will be adjusted in the future!
