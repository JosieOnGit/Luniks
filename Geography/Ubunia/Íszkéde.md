# Íszkéde
Íszkéde is located far in the east of Ellitroomi, connecting to the **Láávitlan Sea**. Because of its poor location and connections to other nations, it hasn't had the same growth spurt that the other nations, which are located on the west of Ubunia and east of Vestia, had experienced in their first years on the planet. 
## Mizimlán (Capital)
**Mizimlán**'s strategic position far under the mountains gives it the slight glimmer of hope for further development in a nation that's otherwise poorly accessible by mountain ranges, tundrae, and scattered land. Despite it being closer to **Ellitróómi** rather than the **Láávitlan Sea**, its connections with its neighbouring nation still gives it the opportunity to steadily grow over time.
## Máásëc sol Láávitlan
**Máásëc sol Láávitlan**, more commonly written as just "**Máásëc**" or "**Máásëc s.L.**", is a coastal city that connects to the **Láávitlan Sea**, opening the doors for **Íszkéde** to connect to the nations on **Vestia**, and engage in a much more accessible means of trade with other nations, rather than doing so exclusively through **Ellitróómi**.
