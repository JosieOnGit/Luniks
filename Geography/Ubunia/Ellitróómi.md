Located to the far northeast of Ubunia lays the nation of Ellitróómi. Despite it's phenomenal size, it's mostly a barren landscape covered by thick blankets of snow and filled to the brim with tight forests, similarly to Siberia on Earth. Because of this, its population is fairly low and is most dense near its borders with Thórirsant and Kérisant, as well as a few cities near Íszkédir. 

Its national language is **Ellitróómisi**, a fairly underdeveloped and regional language that is visually similar to Finnish or Estonian, which is most prominent in the villages that lay in the tundras. Despite this, the most prominent languages in the city are usually **Luniksan** and **English**, albeit with a very thick regional accents and dialects, making is harder to understand and strike a conversation.
