## Iskedir (Capital)
Literally translating to "Within the towns", Iskedir was the first town to be settled within the Mónsan Republic, and has since grown to become the biggest city within the nation. Positioned near the eastern part of the country, it's also a transport hub to every other town and city, as well as an international hub that connects to other nations.
