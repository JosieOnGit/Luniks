When the Allocation of Vestia was drafted soon after the discovery of Luniks, a central-nortern area on the continent was marked and drawn to be settled by citizens of modern Taiwan, which gives the nation its traditional Chinese and other Asian inspired culture. Despite the harmony it once had throughout the nation after the Allocation of Vestia completed in 2011, the province of **Vao** couldn't maintain that harmony for long. Citing a "vast disconnect from the culture of Zhuehai to the people of Vao", it formally and peacefully seceded in **2014**, and slowly but surely managed to develop itself into the quiet and peaceful mountain nation that it is today (2075).

Despite the loss of the province of Vao, Zhuehai still flourished and grew exponentially with the support of **Hammerhead**, giving the industry a space to grow without limits in the province of **Shánzhe**. At the time the ELE connection between **Shánzhe** and **Lyon** opened in **2034**, it had already grown to become the most wealthy and well-faring nation on Vestia, only slightly behind **Thórirsant** on Ubunia.
