# Benelux
Together with [[Denmark]], Benelux (**The Netherlands**, **Belgium**, **Luxembourg**) were given a selection of land to relocate most of their citizens on Earth onto, because the expected rise of water levels was believed to get out of control much quicker than expected, especially with the increase in production for space travel. Because of this, the majority of the nations were expected to be lost to the sea, and for this reason Benelux was founded under one flag on **Vestia**.
