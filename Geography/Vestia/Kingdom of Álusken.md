# Kingdom of Álusken
![[Flag_Álusken.png]]
## Álusken (Capital)
This city is most known for its giant castle in the centre of the city, home to the current King Álusken II. It's most known for its medieval looks and feel, especially in the center of the city, almost making it feel like a time capsule that leads to 700 years back in the past, despite being a city of barely 50 years old. Outside Álusken is a grand, wild forest, known for its mysterious events and creatures that may hide inside (See: [[Álusken's Mysteries]]).
## Keustellet
Unlike the capital, Keustellet is a very modern city, matching the looks of Cévok, Sattijáárva, and Sorskist, with skyscrapers nested tightly together in the city centres and broad parks and housing spreading over the rest of the city. This modern cityscape can exist for Keustellet too, since Álusken II's rule does not cover Keustellet, which means it doesn't need to adhere the building and design standards of the capital.
