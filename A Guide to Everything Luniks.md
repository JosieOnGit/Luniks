# A Guide to Everything Luniks
To most, this entire repository filled to the brim with loosely related stories and documentations of events, might be **very overwhelming**. That's why this little document should help you guide through the maze of stories that the world of Luniks has to offer!

# Geography
The **Geography** is fairly straightforward. One document and several folders are here that are infrequently updated, which are:
- **Adding a Nation to Lúniks**: An older (February 2023) document that remains unfinished but briefly describes the planet map and its continents, and how I struggle to place certain nations on top if it. Because of the high velocity in which nations and stories add new places and cities to the existing nations, I paused this while I develop those stories, before I'll continue writing this particular document.
- **Continent Folders**: These folders are divided up into the four continents, each of which contain separate documents of each of the nations that are present on that continent, which themselves have a bit of history and contain a list of cities and towns within that nation.

# Historic Events
**Historic Events** is the maze of the repository, where every developed story is written down in. We'll go through every story, and tailing documents together, so you can dive in wherever you wish!
## GHOST TEMPLES
Main document: [[GHOST TEMPLES]]. \
**GHOST TEMPLES** is the biggest story to date, that encompasses the entire planet in various temples, where people that have passed will have a chance at death to be reborn there, and continue to live, albeit in the shadows of the "real" world. 

A quick rundown of the Temples, its routines and traditions, and a brief description of all stages in the lifecycle of a ghost, are all available at [[GHOST TEMPLES#A quick rundown]]. Additionally, all stages have an accompanied story (or several), which are all available in the similarly named document in the folder.

## Leremkov Trials
Main document: [[Leremkov Trials]]. \
The **Leremkov Trials** were the first story that overflooded in content and became too big to be first spread out over several documents, and lead to a snowball effect in the amount of stories that were created over time, to the point where we are now (January 2024).

In short: The **Leremkov Trials** describe the story of *Vitaly Leremkov*, who was a Russian-Polish biologist that used his knowledge in DNA splicing and alteration to inject animal genes into human DNA, which he then sold through fake vaccinations, which were masked as vaccinations for COVID or Influenza. In doing so, his self-created virus quickly began spreading throughout Kérisant, where he was located at the time, and eventually through Poland on Earth, where he moved after a few years to take revenge on his home town of Poznań. 

Connected to the **Leremkov story** as a whole are:
- **BREACH**: A military/detective focused story where *Dénis Terczekv*, together with a series of colleagues at his institute, research and track down the source of the Leremkov disease, in order to strike it down and prevent further spread from happening.
- **LOGS**: A series of handwritten notes by *Dénis Terczekv*, where he goes through his own thoughts and experiences with the Leremkov disease, which he writes to his wife, who had passed as a result of this disease.
- **PENDULUM**: A story (Combination of the original drafts "**Stacy & David**" and "**Vienna & Olen**") about the organisation that aids and helps people affected by Leremkov to adapt to their new bodies and minds through hypnosis and therapy.

## Stories
The **Stories** folder is a collection of unrelated drafts or stories that don't currently have a connection to any of the existing stories. These are:
- **Alkéisa's Ring**: A development note of the deployment of **The Ring**, a planetary ring that protects the planet of Luniks, which was designed and built by Alkéisa.
- **Álusken's Mysteries**: Currently a single story, but has the potential to grow and expand to be sorted out into its own folder as well. The nation of Álusken has a very medieval feel, especially around its capital city, where the reigning king actively denies and suppresses modern technologies. Around this city, strange occurrences happen, which are described in this document.
- **Liétivus Pact**: Originally drafted in 2020, this is a resolution proposed by **Sander Liétivus**, in an effort to calm down the ongoing *Civil War* in *Kósfrii*. However, this doesn't currently exist yet, as the timeline isn't adjusted to this war, but it's still listed for archival purposes and might return to see the light of day in the further future.
- **Story Drafts**: This document contains small entries that are seeking insertion in the grand scheme of things, and can also be considered drafts that came across my mind in a single moment. The progress on the several drafts, as well as their redirections, can all be found here with an explanation as to what their intended purpose might become.
- **OSLO REVOLUTION**: Originally drafted in 2018, this document will soon list all the past developments on this revolution while it's actively being altered to fit into modern day Luniks, before it'll gradually grow bigger and fit nicely into the bigger picture.

## TRAVEL RISK
Main document: [[TRAVEL RISK]]. \
**TRAVEL RISK** is the most recently created story, which lays focus on the grim reality that takes place after the *Máneán collapse*, which affected the nations of **Zakh'háfo** and **Máneá**. Because of the collapse of the nation, it was split into two, and were quickly plunged into an economic crisis which soon led to disaster. Because of this drastic change, the average wellbeing of the citizens declined, and drug usage rapidly increased. **TRAVEL RISK** encompasses the various drugs that are now present in the two nations, and lays the focus on the various characters that are drafted, and how they deal with this change, or how they deal the drugs. 

## Lists
Lastly, three lists are present: \
- **List of historic events**: This list discusses the brief history of how modern Luniks came to be, going over where the timeline from our real world deviated and how Luniks quickly became habitable for modern human life.
- **List of notable names**: This list mentions various company names, that might frequently appear throughout all stories.
- **List of notable people**: This folder has been extracted, and now serves as a diversion document that leads to the respective character lists of all the stories that have been made so far. 

# Languages
**Luniks** is also home to various languages, and in this folder, three of those languages (which are constructed and hand-made), are described.

## Luniksan (Lúnikska)
The language that is most dominant throughout the planet, aside from English and other languages that are thriving on Earth, is **Luniksan**, which is a combination of various European languages into one. Within its own folder, an older drafted script is present, as well as a basic explanation of its history, as well as basic grammar rules and vocabulary.

This language is **not** actively being developed, and is very subject to change. I plan to continue working on this when I get the time to, but that vastly depends on how much I plan to add to existing stories, as well as adding new stories. 

## Ellitroomi / Malawi
**Ellitróómisi** and **Malaui** are two more languages, that are **not** actively being developed. These will most likely never see the light of day, apart from being mentioned in various stories and maybe containing a sentence or two, but neither of these languages will ever be developed to the same extent as **Luniksan** is, simply because it's too much for me to do so.


# Happy Reading!
Thank you so much for taking interest in my stories and my vast journey of worldbuilding! I hope I can inspire you to write your own stories yourself as well, and if you ever do, let me know! Everyone can pick up a pen or keyboard and write down a few thoughts and notes, no matter how big, small, simple, or complex they may be, this world also started from a small draft back in 2018, and look where it is now!

If I can do so, then so can you! Happy reading and happy writing!
