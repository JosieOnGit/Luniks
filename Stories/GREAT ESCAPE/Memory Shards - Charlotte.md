# Memory Shards - Charlotte
## May 21st, 2075 - Duisburg, Germany
### What more lingers in the air
Deep into the night, deep into an underground, once thought to be abandoned club in the very heart of what once was Duisburg, Germany. An endless spiral of crime had brought the city down to the ground, a fate that many big cities throughout Earth had experienced, and a fate that was also all too familiar on nations on Lúniks, too. Crime spiralled out of control, and soon, an influx of drug trade and illegal activities would keep all of these cities in dismay for the foreseeable future. And as a result, it wasn't uncommon for hitmen to find their way here, too. After all, with a crime-infested city such as this, bounties ought to be claimed, and who better to claim them than freelance hitmen?

Two knocks on the bar table next to her brought her back to her attention, and with her ears perked upright, she removed the earbuds that were clipped to her ears and looked to her left where the tapping had come from. It was an unfamiliar face to her, but one she could only imagine to be her client. After all, a quick glance at the clock hanging above the doorframe told her that her supposed client was a minute early to arrive, standing beside her at 22:44, instead of 22:45. **"Client Masi..?"** She asked with a puzzled expression on her face, her right hand moving to rest on her thigh, standing ready in case it was someone other than the client after all, but instead, the person to her left simply nodded. *"Surprised you remember my name, you must be Charlotte?"* \
Charlotte simply nodded back. **"One of many names I've born."** She sighed, averting her eyes away from the client, and instead faced the crowd that was listening to the loud techno music that was blasting at the very end of the stage. Her eyes remained drawn to the stage, but her ears diverted her attention back to her client-to-be. **"You're not here without reason, are you?"** She said, raising her tone just slightly in annoyance. The man behind laughed quietly, and gesturing towards the bartender for a glass of whiskey, his attention returned to Charlotte, too. *"Of course not! Would I take your treasured time in desolate Germany just to treat you for a glass of liquor?"* He laughed, and nodding to the bartender upon receiving his requested glass, his tone shifted into one that was a little deeper and more professional. *"Timoth Makro. Affiliated with the Brandt faction. Supposedly has a faction of his own in Mülheim, produces Neurokicks there. Something along those lines."* He began, and ruffling through his jacket, he took out a small, A5-sized folder with a mugshot and important info related to this supposed "Timoth". *"Not much more I know, except for this. Bounty's climbing to €1,5 million. You're getting 20% of that. In it?"* \
Turning around once more, she sighed quietly under her breath, and taking the small folder that was on the bar table, she inspected the mugshot thoroughly, pointing out a small scar on his cheek, discolouration on his nose, and a scruffy, short beard. **"Mülheim?"** She asked, her eyes averting from the mugshot to those of the client before her, idly flipping through the pages as she thought to herself out loud. A 20% share of that bounty on his head would set her steady for at least another month, and closing her eyes, she pinched the bridge of her nose, the music somehow becoming louder with each kick. **"Doable. Gone in a week."** She replied firmly, putting the folder in her own pocket and promptly holding out her hand, shaking it with the client that sat before her. Gesturing towards the bartender, she handed them a €20,- bill, and promptly stepped away from her chair, her long jacket waving behind her above her tail as she was suddenly abrupted by her client calling her name as her hand remained in her pocket, reaching for her earbuds. *"Hang on a sec', Charlotte!"* He smiled, stepping away from the barstool as he quickly followed behind her, guiding her just outside the door with his glass of whiskey in his offhand. *"Just out of pure curiosity, you've built up a reputation like that, while being so easily recognisable?"* He asked, his eyes averting to the top of her head, in awe at the size of the ears. Her left ear was more tainted than her other, bearing many scars and being chipped in multiple places, only an earring decorated it. Her brows furrowed. **"You've never seen a Vulpine before?"** She asked, slightly annoyed as she clipped one earbud to her ear stubbornly. *"Not that."* He sighed, averting his eyes to the right. **"You only know of me because of all the blood I've shed, no?"** Charlotte frowned, her voice deepening as her azure eyes deepened even further in colour, shimmering in the poorly-lit stairwell towards the main street. Staying quiet for just a moment, her client sighed, admitting defeat. *"I only knew your name, your hitlist, and your whereabouts."* He sighed, adjusting his hat slightly. *"Admittedly, not your appearance."* He continued, holding out his hand once more as a means of apologising, not willing to muddy the waters before even setting foot within them. Without much further thought, Charlotte shook his hand, a warm smile undoing the stern gaze that was on her face not even a minute ago. **"Let's keep it that way, Mr. Masi.."** She replied, a slight but warm smile on her face, as she clipped the other earbud to her ear as well. **"Here's how we'll stay in touch."** She began, turning around to face the door that led into the club they had just exited out of. It belonged to a club called **Bandidos Place**, an almost century-old club that had seen much, much better days in the past, and while it was still alive and well, in the death-ridden city of Duisburg, it wasn't much about the music anymore, but rather about the bounties that were to be claimed in the ever-growing drugs circuits. **"Bands tend to play here every now and again too."** Charlotte smiled, pointing at the wall to the left of the door, with at least ten layers of posters and advertisements having been plastered over it in the past year. **"Professional Porch Pirates plays here, your target is dead."** She began. **"If Roadkill Deer plays here, your target has fled, and the kill will be delayed."** She continued, and averting her eyes to the client, her brows furrowed once more. **"If neither band plays, I'm dead."** \
Her client's eyes opened wide upon the mere thought, and watching Charlotte turn around, he could only watch her climb up the stairs into the endless sea of streetlights illuminating the barren city deep into the evening. **"Hope you like rock, dear client."** She giggled, looking backwards over her shoulder once more as she ascended the flight of stairs. **"Triple P has been doing great. You won't want to miss that performance here next week."**
