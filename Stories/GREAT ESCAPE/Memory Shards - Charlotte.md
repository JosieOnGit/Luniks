# Memory Shards - Charlotte
## March 11th, 2075 - Esch-sur-Alzette, Lëtzebuerg
### Drafted
*// She's long lost track of the amount of missions like these she's come to past. But despite the blurry memories of her previous objectives, the mission she is about to enter is mission number **one** under a new contact person: **Ypsilon**. Despite being a faceless contact point, it's one that proves to be viable, and one that can be trusted, even with how easy it is to backstab someone in the modern circuits.* \
*// Tasked with completing the murder on **Jacob Moritz**, another old classmate of hers in college, she finds herself in the ever familiar hilly region in the surroundings of **Esch-sur-Alzette**. Receiving nothing but a time and place from Ypsilon, it's entirely up to herself to find a place to strike from the shadows.* 

*// Getting into the zone is no longer a hard feat for Charlotte to achieve, but neither is it something she enjoys doing. Following Ypsilon's last update, the two cease contact and Charlotte moves into position. Hidden in the depths of the tight forests near the valleys at Esch-sur-Alzette, she narrowly follows her target as he follows his routine trail up and down the passes of the nature reserve in the south of Lëtzebuerg. Roaming and trailing Jacob in the shadows beside him, it doesn't take long for the memories to seep back into her mind, and the idea of "living in the shadows" becomes clear to her once more, leaving her previously activated focus dwindling, almost causing her to give away her position in an instant.* \
*// Jacob reaches the top of one of the valleys, and promptly takes a pause and a breather to enjoy the view, such is routine for him, as Ypsilon had told Charlotte. Wasting not a single second, she fires a shot directed as his calf, causing him to lose balance while she closes the distance between the two, and pausing before the collapsed and grunting Jacob, she now stares him directly in the eyes, the blur of the picatinny rail on top of her pistol blocking the view between herself and her target. Her eyes are squinted, her brows are furrowed, and even though she's entirely focused on completing her contract, the familiar face of Jacob ‒ even 10 years later ‒ brings up memories from their respective pasts, and Jacob realises and remembers this too. **"Charlotte..?"** He grunts, his eyes open wide not only in confusion, but also in regret. After 10 years, had his behaviour caught up on him? **"Moritz."** Charlotte replies quietly, a sigh trailing her words as their two gazes met one another. Despite her focus, her ears refused to maintain their position, instinctively drooping to the sides the longer the memories flowed through her head. **"I guess fate caught up with me, huh.."** Jacob grunts, making Charlotte's aim become shakier with every second. Despite their troubled past together, Jacob was one of the "better racists" to her, and even though in hindsight it meant nothing to her, she still preferred to not need to talk to him face to face like this. But it was far too late for making any changes in that. A quick pull of the trigger could solve her problems, but she didn't want an easy way out of this. She had to face her own nightmares, too. **"Sorry, Jacob."** She began, a heavy sigh leaving her lips a she aimed her pistol to the gravel path beneath her feet. **"I.. should be sorry."** Jacob begins, a deep inhale preceding his next words, his voice trembling the longer blood began to seep from his calf. If we wasn't to be treated soon, it'd be a matter of time before he'd bleed out. **"I had it coming. Just.. figured it'd have happened sooner. Marvin, Sasha, even Noah.."** Charlotte gritted her teeth the more names he listed. It were all previous classmates of hers, and all of them fell into the list of people who had mistreated her, assaulted her ‒ physically or verbally ‒ over her existence, not performances. He groaned quietly as he lifted up his hand into the air, inviting Charlotte to hold it, as a troubled smile formed on his weakening face. **"I suppose there's no mending to my fate."** He began, a single tear beginning to roll down his cheek, before he found the strength to continue. **"There's only one ending possible, if you're wielding and firing the weapon, then.."** A deep sigh exited his lips, and hesitantly, Charlotte took a hold of Jacob's hand before he continued. **"Nach.. I want to apologise for back then. My actions were unwarranted, and nothing will change that."** Another deep breath entered his lungs. **"Charlotte, promise me you'll travel to Luniks, to Lëtzebuerg. You'll be accepted, without worries for existence, for who you are, I guarantee.."** Charlotte's brows remained furrowed, but the troubles on her mind remained, too. **"For me, bury me in nature.."*** \
*// A single gunshot echoes through the valleys, followed by the rustling of the trees from the birds escaping the site of the murder on Jacob Moritz. Her ears were folded flat on her head in anger, and she faced away from the now-deceased body of her old classmate that she had just taken the life of. The puddle of blood slowly grew, and dripped downwards into the forest beneath the cliff of their current valley. **"Lies!!"** Charlotte hissed through her teeth, which were kept gritted ever since she pulled the trigger. In a swift motion, she turned around and gave a firm kick to the deceased body at her feet, and with heavy breaths, she could only watch the puddle of blood grow as the warmth and colour gradually left Jacob's skin. **"No place is home for me. Neither here, neither there."** Slowly, her ears drooped upwards, and respecting his final wish, she grabbed Jacob's body by his jacket, and gently guided it down the slope of the cliff. Letting go, she watched it topple downwards, and her ears twitched as the sound of rustling leaves and impacts against the trees in the forest beneath reached an abrupt end. **"There's no such thing as utopia."***

*// "What was the holdup, Zeta?" Ypsilon suddenly asked over her earpiece, startling her for a moment, having forgotten they had been watching her the entire time. It left a shiver run through her body. No mission had gone under constant supervision before.* \
*// **"My mind caught up to me. I shook it off."** She sighed, her brows furrowed as she finished, her hand gripping tightly around her pistol's grip. Staring down at the forest beneath, another deep sigh left her lips as she closed her eyes.* \
*// "Good. Losing your focus is a slippery slope, Zeta. I hope you'll keep this in mind in your future missions. Do not let your past disturb your present. It will lead to your death."*

**!! Eventually, Ypsilon will develop into becoming the antagonist in Charlotte's arc for the Great Escape, which itself will tie in with the name of the story. Blinded by her past, with no hope for her future, she obeys and listens to whatever it is that Ypsilon orders for her, knowing no better. But now having met Miya, she learns that there *is* a better world out there, and over time, meeting other people just like her (Luniksan/Leremkovi races on Earth), means that a spark has been lit deep inside her mind. With Miya having promised to protect her at all costs, she learns that, after all, maybe Jacob *had* been right, and maybe Luniks *is* the right place for her. But leaving for Luniks would mean that Ypsilon would lose their most valuable asset. There is no chance that they'd let this happen.**

### Past, Present, Future
*"May this mission spearhead a successful collaboration, Zeta."*

A quiet sigh left her lips as she put her phone back in her pocket as her contact ended the connection between the two of them, leaving behind only the rustle of the wind through the blankets of leaves on the treetops above her. It was an ever familiar sound to her, one that she had frown used to throughout her youth. Coincidentally, the mission she had just accepted brought her exactly there: *Esch-sur-Alzette*, located within the hills on the doorstep of the Ardennes in the south of Lëtzebuerg. She'd spent many hours here together with her parents when she was still young, and even though the memories of going out camping and hiking with her family swirled through her head, the feeling of cold iron on the right of her waist reminded her of her present. Holstered on her right leg was her tried and tested Hammerhead pistol, one that had seen action for almost ten years straight. An **SP-17**, complete with a customised silencer and customised grip, issued to her soon after she fell victim to the cruel circuit she had been lost deep within in since. The endless lifecycle of a hitman-for-hire, taking on missions to take the lives of others, simply to pursue their own. For Charlotte, this was the only life she had grown to known. \
The buzz on her phone made Charlotte's fingertips leave the cold barrel of her pistol, and taking it out of her pocket once more, her new contact supplied the vital information to her. *"Ypsilon"*, their name was, and despite claiming to have been in the hitman circuit for decades, she was exceptionally sceptical about their abilities. But shaking her head, she knew that this wasn't the time to worry about who sat behind that mask right now, and looking at her phone. her eyes widened as soon as she read her new target's name. **"Jacob Moritz.."** She mumbled to herself, memories flashing before her eyes while they absentmindedly continued reading the rest of the text. A time and location were named, and it was up to her to figure out a way to tie all this information together into a bullet that would pierce through his head perfectly. Inhaling deeply, she exhaled deeply soon afterwards, letting all the memories exit along her breath. **"Jacob was a classmate in college.."** Her mind whispered to her. But money was on the line, and she was well aware that time was of the essence. There'd be enough time for her to dwell on her thoughts after completing the mission, regardless of who, regardless of where, and furrowing her brows, her ears folded backwards slightly as she took the first of many steps to come through the tightly-packed forest she stood within.

*"Your target has reached Léiffrächen. Ending contact."* Ypsilon informed her over her earpiece, and with her ears continuing to twitch back and forth as they listened to the combined ambience of the forest and Ypsilon's intel, they gradually folded downwards as she zoned in for the mission to come. Despite the cryptic messages and eerie tone to their voice, so far, Ypsilon had been absolutely correct about every call. It was a type of pinpoint precision that she hadn't experienced with any other client before, but one that raised concerns for her, too.


## May 7th, 2075 - Duisburg, Germany
### What more lingers in the air
Deep into the night, deep into an underground, once thought to be abandoned club in the very heart of what once was Duisburg, Germany. An endless spiral of crime had brought the city down to the ground, a fate that many big cities throughout Earth had experienced, and a fate that was also all too familiar on nations on Lúniks, too. Crime spiralled out of control, and soon, an influx of drug trade and illegal activities would keep all of these cities in dismay for the foreseeable future. And as a result, it wasn't uncommon for hitmen to find their way here, too. After all, with a crime-infested city such as this, bounties ought to be claimed, and who better to claim them than freelance hitmen?

Two knocks on the bar table next to her brought her back to her attention, and with her ears perked upright, she removed the earbuds that were clipped to her ears and looked to her left where the tapping had come from. It was an unfamiliar face to her, but one she could only imagine to be her client. After all, a quick glance at the clock hanging above the doorframe told her that her supposed client was a minute early to arrive, standing beside her at 22:44, instead of 22:45. **"Client Masi..?"** She asked with a puzzled expression on her face, her right hand moving to rest on her thigh, standing ready in case it was someone other than the client after all, but instead, the person to her left simply nodded. *"Surprised you remember my name, you must be Charlotte?"* \
Charlotte simply nodded back. **"One of many names I've borne."** She sighed, averting her eyes away from the client, and instead faced the crowd that was listening to the loud techno music that was blasting at the very end of the stage. Her eyes remained drawn to the stage, but her ears diverted her attention back to her client-to-be. **"You're not here without reason, are you?"** She said, raising her tone just slightly in annoyance. The man behind laughed quietly, and gesturing towards the bartender for a glass of whiskey, his attention returned to Charlotte, too. *"Of course not! Would I take your treasured time in desolate Germany just to treat you for a glass of liquor?"* He laughed, and nodding to the bartender upon receiving his requested glass, his tone shifted into one that was a little deeper and more professional. *"Timoth Makro. Affiliated with the Brandt faction. Supposedly has a faction of his own in Mülheim, produces Neurokicks there. Something along those lines."* He began, and ruffling through his jacket, he took out a small, A5-sized folder with a mugshot and important info related to this supposed "Timoth". *"Not much more I know, except for this. Bounty's climbing to €1,5 million. You're getting 10% of that. In it?"* \
Turning around once more, she sighed quietly under her breath, and taking the small folder that was on the bar table, she inspected the mugshot thoroughly, pointing out a small scar on his cheek, discolouration on his nose, and a scruffy, short beard. **"Mülheim?"** She asked, her eyes averting from the mugshot to those of the client before her, idly flipping through the pages as she thought to herself out loud. A 20% share of that bounty on his head would set her steady for at least another month, and closing her eyes, she pinched the bridge of her nose, the music somehow becoming louder with each kick. **"Doable. Gone in a week."** She replied firmly, putting the folder in her own pocket and promptly holding out her hand, shaking it with the client that sat before her. Gesturing towards the bartender, she handed them a €20,- bill, and promptly stepped away from her chair, her long jacket waving behind her above her tail as she was suddenly abrupted by her client calling her name as her hand remained in her pocket, reaching for her earbuds. *"Hang on a sec', Charlotte!"* He smiled, stepping away from the barstool as he quickly followed behind her, guiding her just outside the door with his glass of whiskey in his offhand. *"Just out of pure curiosity, you've built up a reputation like that, while being so easily recognisable?"* He asked, his eyes averting to the top of her head, in awe at the size of the ears. Her left ear was more tainted than her other, bearing many scars and being chipped in multiple places, only an earring decorated it. Her brows furrowed. **"You've never seen a Vulpine before?"** She asked, slightly annoyed as she clipped one earbud to her ear stubbornly. *"Not that."* He sighed, averting his eyes to the right. **"You only know of me because of all the blood I've shed, no?"** Charlotte frowned, her voice deepening as her azure eyes deepened even further in colour, shimmering in the poorly-lit stairwell towards the main street. Staying quiet for just a moment, her client sighed, admitting defeat. *"I only knew your name, your hitlist, and your whereabouts."* He sighed, adjusting his hat slightly. *"Admittedly, not your appearance."* He continued, holding out his hand once more as a means of apologising, not willing to muddy the waters before even setting foot within them. Without much further thought, Charlotte shook his hand, a warm smile undoing the stern gaze that was on her face not even a minute ago. **"Let's keep it that way, Mr. Masi.."** She replied, a slight but warm smile on her face, as she clipped the other earbud to her ear as well. **"Here's how we'll stay in touch."** She began, turning around to face the door that led into the club they had just exited out of. It belonged to a club called **Bandidos Place**, an almost century-old club that had seen much, much better days in the past, and while it was still alive and well, in the death-ridden city of Duisburg, it wasn't much about the music anymore, but rather about the bounties that were to be claimed in the ever-growing drugs circuits. **"Bands tend to play here every now and again too."** Charlotte smiled, pointing at the wall to the left of the door, with at least ten layers of posters and advertisements having been plastered over it in the past year. **"Professional Porch Pirates plays here, your target is dead."** She began. **"If Roadkill Deer plays here, your target has fled, and the kill will be delayed."** She continued, and averting her eyes to the client, her brows furrowed once more. **"If neither band plays, I'm dead."** \
Her client's eyes opened wide upon the mere thought, and watching Charlotte turn around, he could only watch her climb up the stairs into the endless sea of streetlights illuminating the barren city deep into the evening. **"Hope you like rock, dear client."** She giggled, looking backwards over her shoulder once more as she ascended the flight of stairs. **"Triple P has been doing great. You won't want to miss that performance here next week."**
