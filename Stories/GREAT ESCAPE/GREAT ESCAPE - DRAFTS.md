# GREAT ESCAPE - Drafts
## Character Introduction: Charlotte
*"Charlotte Floquet? You are up next, please come forward."* \
The atmosphere in the room was uneasy, and with a deep, deflated sigh, she complied and sat up from her seat in the waiting room. Just two doors further, her doctor was waiting for her, and with her hand gripped tightly on her upper left arm, she suppressed the stinging pain she felt whenever she moved it. It belonged to the remains of a stab wound, and despite having been treated at the ER in the same night she attained it, the pain did not subside since. 

Having shaken the doctor's hand, he immediately got to work from the very moment she sat down on the bed, wasting no time in treating the wound when necessary. But wanting to keep the room from falling silent, questions arose. Questions that she had been avoiding for so long. \
*"Ms. Floquet, this wound.. that's not an accident."* Her doctor asked her with a look of concern on his face. Their eyes met for a moment, before Charlotte averted hers, and her doctor resumed inspecting and treating the wound. **"I know."** She sighed, her ears folding to the sides, betraying her emotions as she did her best to keep her breathing steady with each sting of pain from the careful prying and treating of her wound. Her right hand was shaking, and her legs were bouncing on the floor from the stress. **"It's.. complicated, Dr. Staveren.."** \
*"Hard to explain? Try it in your native tongue, maybe it'll help carry the message..-"* \
**"Dat wäert net."** Charlotte interrupted her doctor, which caught him off guard for a moment, too. Before long, he continued to treat and disinfect the wound, but in due time, Charlotte cycled her breaths and began to explain the source of the wound that she had attained. **"Awer.. well, I've gotten caught up in a fight."** \
Her doctor kept his focus on the wound for another moment, and upon the sound of Charlotte gritting her teeth upon the application of disinfection alcohol, his focus shifted to the story that she was trying to tell. *"You don't seem the type to pick fights.."* He replied innocently. \
**"Happens more than you'd expect. Easy when you're.."** She paused for a moment, her ears perking upright, before falling down to the sides once more. **"An easy target.."** \
*"You're only sixteen years old, Ms. Floquet, isn't this a little..-"* \
**"Had I not stood my ground, I would be in the hospital instead of having this conversation with you here."** She interrupted him with a stern voice, her brows furrowing. 

Silence filled the room as Dr. Staveren continued to work in silence to treat Charlotte's wound. \
**"Sorry. I got a little.."** \
*"No, Charlotte."* Her doctor now interrupted her, and wrapping a single sheet of bandage around the sealed wound, he looked her straight in the eyes. *"I fully understand. But promise me one thing before I return you home."* \
Charlotte's eyes opened wide. \
*"I don't want any of your enemies in my doctor's office. I don't want your name heard in my office with bad intentions. Please, promise me this one thing."*

---
The knife clattered against the tiled floor, blood spilling in all directions as the blade bounced upwards, and with a lifeless expression, she dropped the body to the floor, blood spilling from their back as their life had already left long ago. **"Sorry, Doctor."** She said with an empty smile, watching the white hoodie slowly turn a deep, crimson red, dyed in the blood from wearer that had just died. With a deep sigh, she turned into the other direction, her own knife sheathed once more on the clasp that was fitted snugly at her waist. **"I broke that promise."** \
With a deep sigh, she stared at the lifeless body for another minute or two, watching the crimson spot of blood on the white hoodie grow larger as the puddle of blood beneath them followed suit, soaking the tiled floor and staining it in due time. **"Marvin, wasn't it?"** She snickered, kicking against the lifeless body, blood getting on the soles of her pitch-black shoes. **"Top of your class.. Destined to become a top pharmacist.."** She continued, moving forwards to stand before what once was Marvin's head. Her brows furrowed, and in a sudden motion, a strong kick against the lifeless body created ripples in the puddle of blood beneath it. **"Shame. What a shame. Feeding off the weak for your own success. You were scum from the very start, weren't you?"** She chuckled, turning around once more as she picked the knife she had dropped back up from the floor, and stabbing it deeply into the back of Marvin's body, she grinned widely before walking forwards, back out of the pitch-black room that she stood within. **"Unfortunately for you, I was not weak."**

### Highlights / Drafts:
- While having a very French surname ‒ *"Floquet"* ‒ Charlotte is not French at **all**. Her distant family originates from France, but she's been born in Lëtzebuerg (Benelux) and has stayed there for most of her life. 
- Despite being born in Lëtzebuerg ‒ which is a sovereign nation in the Benelux cluster ‒ Charlotte does not speak a single word of **Dutch**, even though this is the most predominant language in this cluster of nations, spoken in The Netherlands and Flanders. Additionally, she studied in The Netherlands, but only picked up common phrases and never learned the language more properly.
- Charlotte is a **Vulpine**, which is a race that originates from Lúniks, and almost exclusively appears there. Despite so, she was born in Lëtzebuerg to a human father and Vulpine mother. Her father is originally from *Germany*, while her mother is *Belgian*, with family roots tracing back to *Máneá* and *France*. It left her as the odd one out in a nation that was predominantly human, which made her an easy target for being bullied, and an easy target for racism. In the end, this fueled her revenge against **Marvin Scheitler**, who was a leading figure in directing hate and racism towards Charlotte in her college years.
- Back in school, Charlotte was renowned for her *precision* in various arts subjects, being frequently told that she had an eye for detail, and that she should use it in work that required a high amount of precision, such as *architecture*, *chemistry*, or something in the *mechanical*/*technological* field. Instead, Charlotte used her precision on the shooting range, and despite being told to pick up professional shooting as a sport, it forever remained on the table, and her shots soon became shots fired from weaponry.
- The first victim of hers ‒ which was the force that set the ball rolling into the endless, downwards spiral of the assassination circuit ‒ was her very own father, *Florenz Floquet*. At just the age of **17**, it was a kitchen knife that she had picked up from the kitchen drawer in secret after the 14th "incident", which was how she referred to an argument or act of violence from her father onto her mother. Despite being wealthy, her father was anything but nicely, the criminal circuit of Duisburg having gotten to his head and ultimately leading to him falling into a spiral of corruption. It were precisely those troubles that he rubbed off onto Charlotte's mother, *Linde Vócklaz*, which soon spiralled into domestic violence. Charlotte kept count of each of these "incidents", their severity increasing each time, and at exactly **01:52**, the month and year that her parents had married in, death divorced them, carried out by their very own daughter. **"Behandelt dech richteg.** (*Treats you right*)**"**, she had said upon dropping the knife on the bedroom floor. Not long thereafter, she fled the house and moved in together with a friend she had made at her college, but ultimately, it traced back to her and she was soon forced to not only drop out of college, but remain on the run forever. A feat she not only accomplished with success, but one that was noted by several hitmen. And within a matter of weeks, she was soon back in the shadows.

## Cottbuser Cult - Draft
Mentioned in [[GREAT ESCAPE#Massy-Palaiseau, 23 15]] is the **Cottbuser cult**, of which Charlotte's *father* was a part of before his murder. 
### Zooming out
The **UGHR**, *"Union for Global Human Rights"*, originated in Brandenburg, Germany, and is an organisation that claims to "Stand for human rights," promising to erase any sort of discrimination or imparities to not just residents of Germany, but throughout all of Earth. Despite being labelled as a union that stands for human rights, no matter where or when anyone might be residing, it is actually more globally known as the **"Cottbuser Cult"** for doing the exact opposite, instead discriminating others as a means of providing aid and support for those it "deems suitable."
### Brief history
Being founded in **1993**, in the gradually developing city of **Cottbus**, *Germany*, the then-branded **"UHR"** foundation provided residents of Cottbus, and eventually all of Brandenburg and Berlin, with an opportunity to still provide labour to any person that may be impaired by any means. With a widely positive reception throughout Brandenburg, it expanded throughout the rest of old Eastern Germany in **1998**, before becoming a national foundation in **2002**, providing aid to any German resident where necessary.
### The spiral downwards
Upon the settlement of Luniks from **2005** onwards, it didn't take until **2027** before the first settlers returned to Earth, and with the different nature in orbit and in the atmosphere of Luniks, it only took one generation for genetic differences to become noticeable, as new races naturally developed. While having become a respected minority on Luniks, and eventually growing into an equally divided and respected race on the neighbouring planet, back on Earth, they were not as easily respected as they might have gotten used to.

Textbook racism and discrimination began to appear, and with the **UGHR** having attained a global status and respective name since **2018**, it began to systematically push residents of Earth forward, making sure to avoid giving opportunities to any "Newer generation race" from Luniks, and in the following decades, systemic isolation and segregation had become the new standard. While Luniks had become the utopia that Earth had longed to be, they instead crippled back down to their century-old roots, creating a dystopia for the newer generations to follow, discriminating them while they knew no different. 

It's here where the term **"Cottbuser Cult"** originates from, using it as a way to refer to the **UGHR** without mentioning the name directly. Violence was to be expected with conflicts between the various Luniksan races and this cult, and especially in the late 2060s, this violence instead led to even harsher living conditions for these various races.
### Painting the picture with Charlotte as the brush
Being born as a Vulpine on Earth to a father that has been part of this cult since long before her birth, it isn't a strange development for her to have developed such a stark amount of hate towards not just her father, but to anyone that treats her in a similar fashion as he did. During her high school and college days, while there were spots of light between the seas of discrimination and isolation, it eventually was that sea that had won over her mind, leading to her own spiral downwards in which she enacted revenge on her father and fellow student **Marvin Scheitler**, killing them both with multiple stabs into their neck, respectively. 
### What's next?
Understanding that from **Chapter 4: Untitled** onwards, Miya and Charlotte meet Miya's boss, who is also a part of this Cottbuser Cult, gradual development in both of their characters is expected, and will undoubtedly *be* developed. The lifelong disgust and hate that has built up within Charlotte since her birth has to be suppressed by herself one way or another, as Miya's boss, who *// Presumably:* immediately treats Charlotte as a lesser human being without skills. Stepping in-between, Miya stands up in favour of Charlotte. *// Does he talk it out with his boss in private? Does he paint a good picture of Charlotte for him, in an attempt to convince him to give her a chance anyway, even if he considers her a "worthless outlier/Vulpine?"*

Over time, during missions, Charlotte will get to see various other Luniksan races while on missions, causing a spark to ignite in her mind. Is she really at home on Earth, even if she'd been born her and lived all her life? \
*// Especially during off-missions, she might see an opportunity to strike a conversation with someone in a café, for example. Maybe topics such as interstellar travel (through the ELE) will come up, which in turn, might cause that ball in Charlotte's mind to roll even quicker. If she's set to make an ultimate decision, will she choose to stand up for New Generation races on Earth, or will she travel to Luniks to finally live her life the way she'd always wanted to?*
