# Memory Shards - Maria Limáida
A peek into **Maria Limáida**'s daily life. 
# Voyage / Dreamweaver 
## September 8th, 2078 - A forever mark
*// Following Maria's rejection to board the Voyage, and refusing to take Polaris's hand and have her guide her through, the Voyage takes matters into its own hands and forcefully guides Maria to adapt to her role of Cosmic Weaver, regardless of whether she wants to or not. Fate is unrejectable, so to the Voyage, the only way to make her understand is to force her through it, even it premature. A fate written in the stars means that she is forever marked by the stars, and as a result of her first transformation in the Endless Sea of Gold into her "true" form of the Cosmic Weaver, the marks that accentuate that form remain when the immersion breaks and she returns to "home." The teardrop-shaped halo stamped to her back in a deep purple, the flat spots of purple creating intricate strands down her shoulder blades. Forever will she bear these marks, forever will they remind her of her fate. But so will they remind her of her power.*

*"Confidential."* She wrote as the very first word on her page, sighing deeply through her nose, her hand travelling to her forehead upon reading the word once more. **"Obviously.."** She sighed, closing her eyes for a moment to recollect her thoughts. In and out, her breaths went, but they were nowhere near as calming as they once were. Memories flashed back the very second her eyelids kept the outside world from registering in her mind, and instead, they gave it an easy way to depict any horrors, any worries, any nightmares that had been in her head all this time. It reminded her of Amadnésam, the snowy fields. It reminded her of the water beneath her feet in an otherwise deep-blue void, accentuated by an ever-increasing amount of golden sparkles. Inhaling deeply, those sparkles reappeared in her hand that held the pencil tightly, and exhaling through her lips, her eyes reopened. 

## March 12th, 2097 - A catalyst it is
*// By now, many years after Maria rejected the Voyage initially, the disturbances she's felt in the cosmos during the rescue of the **Alessi Shuttles** (**Routine Maintenance**) reminded her that her fate was still written in the stars, and ever since that disruption in her stomach left her mind wondering just what it meant, she narrowed it down to two events she could trigger at will: Making fabric appear and weaving it, and travelling cosmically between **Choreos** and **Cintura**. With the surge in research surrounding the ocean planet **Oceana** by **Moondial**, Maria becomes indirectly involved in the project to launch and oversee the research vessels **Glory** and **Honour** alongside Petra Vilassa. But in doing so, the markings on her back that reminded her of her fate began to become more apparent, more vivid, and began to spread out. If her fate was written in the cosmos, was the frequent travel only speeding it up?*

*"Are you leaving now, Maria?"* A younger, kind voice asked from the distance as Maria stood in front of the docking station. Behind this tunnel was the **230 - Bronze Dart**, a lightweight and nimble ship that was almost always exclusively used for short travel between various stations orbiting Lúniks. But this time around, it was set to travel much further. *"Are you sure the 230 will last that far?"* \
Maria shook her head, and a warm smile appeared on her face as the carefully rested her hand against the console's mechanism, and turning around, she faced the researcher's worried expression. It didn't belong to Petra, but rather to someone she hadn't seen too often. She probably worked at a different department. **"Easily, I've flown it further."** She smiled back, and pressing a button on the console her hand rested on, the docking port slowly opened and gave her immediate access to board the Bronze Dart. Wasting no further time, Maria stepped in further, facing forward once more as the doors almost immediately closed behind her the second she stepped into the docking tunnel, isolating her from the ARC, and giving her the room to be all by herself aboard the Bronze Dart.

With a heavy sigh, she sat down in the pilot seat, having taken off her coat that now was hanging from the seat's headrest. She'd walked cleanly past every memoire that decorated this ship. The plaque that immortalised her contributions to the development of this ship, its internal codename during production, but also past the various potted flowers that sat in the makeshift kitchen just outside the pilot's bridge. Instead, her focus was drawn elsewhere as she stared forwards aimlessly, her eyes peeled into the far distance as an endless sea of stars decorated the blackness of space before her. Somewhere out there, Cintura was, and in just a matter of minutes, she'd carry herself with the Bronze Dart towards *Oceana-1*, which was Moondial's orbital station surrounding the similarly-named planet of **Oceana**. It wasn't the bad blood between herself and Petra, the head of Moondial, that disturbed her, no. It was something much more personal than that, and sitting sluggishly in the pilot seat for another moment, that personal disturbance made itself present as the stars seemed to stretch on infinitely. Despite a leap through the Panjit Loop into another fixed point in space causing the light from the stars to stretch on as it warped the ship and its passengers through space, it was much more different this time. The stars in the endless distance seemed to near her, stretching upwards, their light distorting until they almost became graspable for her. **"Strings.."** Maria sighed to herself, and before she knew it, the vivid purple colouring had worked its way downwards towards her fingertips through an intricate pattern of repeating swirls, glowing brightly the entire way. Time and time again, this would happen when she would travel to Cintura, and ever since she rescued the Alessi Shuttles with the help of Harold it only seemed to worsen with each time she jumped to Cintura and back.

*"230, cleared for undocking."* A voice suddenly called into the earpiece in the headrest behind her, snapping her back to her senses as the forced herself to sit back upright, her right hand resting on the engine throttle regulator in an instant as she shook her head and thus herself back awake. **"230, copy.."** She replied sluggishly, her vision blurry from almost dozing off as she pushed her glasses back up the bridge of her nose with her left hand. Flicking two switched own at the main control system in her pilot's seat, a small *thunk* told her enough that the connection between herself, the Bronze Dart, and her prized ARC had been disconnected. As it stood, the Bronze Dart was now entirely by itself. **"230, en route to Cintura - Oceana."** She said in a more relaxed tone, and pushing the throttle forwards ever so slightly, she steered the ship into Lumen's general direction, aiming to orbit Lúniks's moon to sling the Bronze Dart forwards before making the jump towards Cintura and Oceana. \
Another deep sigh exited her lips as her mind wandered off again, and only through routine and autopilot did she manage to allocate power from the reactor towards the Panjit Drive to make the jump towards Oceana the very moment she entered Lumen's orbit. She's done it far too often to have forgotten the way she's always done it, but with her mind freed of the worries of jumping to Oceana, her mind and her eyes instead focused on the intricate patterns spreading over her arms, becoming more thick the more the Panjit Drive charged up and prepared itself and the ship for a leap through space. It took a minute or two, as it was old technology, but it allowed Maria to get a proper look at her arms fully discolouring from her natural skin tone to its unusual, vivid and luminescent purple. 
 
# ARC / Routine Maintenance
## August 7th 2096 - Lightcone announces Dr Vanhuyt's departure
*"Maria, a message from Lightcone."* A voice called for her from the distance, and turning around, Maria saw the figure approach her with a small folder of notes in his hand. Placing her coffee mug on the table before her, her eyes sparkled in surprise after recognising the colour of the stamp on each and every note. *"I've been told not to disclose the contents, but they're important to you."* He added, and taking the folder of notes from him, she whispered a quiet **"Thank you."** before watching him leave into the distance again. 

Taking another sip of her coffee, she removed the stamp on the folder of notes. It was a slightly turquoise-coloured stamp, signifying that they belonged to **Lightcone**, one of **Moonlight**'s divisions, that focused primarily on faster-than-light travel and the research that came with answering the solutions of the speed of light, and everything regarding light as a whole. Putting the cleanly-removed stamp to the side, she saw the logo of Lightcone at the very first page, and folding open the little A5-sized booklet, more questions arose from the very first sentence she read. *"Lightcone announces departure of Dr. Vanhuyt."* \
Maria stared at the sentence for a little longer, processing how much this single question complicated an enormous aspect of the research that the two were conducting aboard the ARC. Moonlight had separated from Carbine over ten years ago, in **2085**, and had cited a "Disparity in research" between the two institutes. Ever since, their teams had moved to Ljivk, and not much collaboration had happened between the two institutes ever since. But Thomas leaving Lightcone left Maria unable to solve the puzzle before her. Her head stung merely thinking about how much more complicated the whole ordeal had become. 

She flipped through the pages, and saw the various titles of research papers that Thomas had published over the past few years. Even during the development of the ARC, he kept in touch with Hammerhead to find solutions for its reactors. But while she saw Thomas's name on documents regarding the ARC, as well as projects within Hammerhead, she took a long sip from her coffee upon reading his name under the codenames of the Alessi Shuttles. Both the **327** and **328** appeared, which already left her puzzling for an answer. **"The engines were Lightcone's?"** She mumbled to herself, trying to figure out a solution herself. Every previous ship, including her very own **Golden Bow**, used the last-generation Panjit Engines for faster-than-light travel, but as stable as they were, they grew old and unreliable quickly. Both Maria and Thomas had put their heads together to find out a way to create a new way to travel faster than light, but it seemed impossible to do in the near future at the time, and with the ARC project approaching too, there was no time to work it out. With Maria's schedule having gotten too busy, she let Thomas work out the engine issue for the Shuttles. **"It's logical.. but it's not documented.."** Maria sighed, pouring more coffee into her cup. She couldn't be bothered to add creamer or sugar to it at the moment, this puzzle had to be solved quickly. \
Reaching the last page in the folder, her eyes opened wide. **"330.."** She thought out loud, remembering that it was Thomas's last project that he had worked on before he left Carbine to return to the ESA on Earth. Maria had called it the **Topaz Spear**, and it was intended to be the next generation of the Alessi Shuttles, but with Thomas's sudden departure, she knew that it would never see the light of day, and remain on paper for the rest of time. But putting the folder to the side, she took a notepad from her coat, and taking off the pen pinned to her shirt, she began to write down her thoughts. **"Contact Lightcone regarding Loop engines.."** She mumbled under her breath as she wrote it down, thinking out loud along the way. **"Ask about Thomas's involvements.. Look through 330's documentation.."** Her pen remained on the paper as her train of thoughts reached an end. Picking up her mug from the table again, she finished the remainder before getting up from her chair. Inhaling deeply through her nose, she exhaled deeply out of her mouth, slowly but surely making her way towards her office. **"No time for breaks.."**

## August 9th 2096 - Resettlement on the ARC
With a deep, deflated sigh, Maria returned to her dormitory. In the past two hours, she had been heavily discussing with not just Petra, but the rest of her research team that was housed in the Northern wing of the ARC, providing Oceana-1 with the native data necessary to relay back and forth the research that was being discovered in the nearby galaxy of Cintura. And the research that they conducted there was the very reason that she reunited with Petra in the first place yesterday. Despite all odds, within a 7-lightyear distance around Earth, they somehow had discovered life, going against all what was previously thought to be true. **"Unbelievable.."** She sighed, collapsing on her desk and pressing her forehead against her arms that rested flat on the table. Petra had made the request for Maria to temporarily settle on Oceana-1 to aid the scientists there with their research, since it had been her own idea to deploy a floating station on Oceana's infinite ocean. Closing her eyes, she exhaled deeply, her breathing gradually warming up her bare arms as her breath was trapped between her arms, face, and the desk. And slowly but surely, she began to doze off, her mind presenting the discussion from yesterday and today once more in her head.

**"It's out of the question. I'm not boarding Oceana-1"** She said with a stern look on her face. Her brows were furrowed, whatever the suggestion had been, it seemed like she was strongly against it. On the opposing end stood Petra, who had her arms crossed in surprise, yet annoyance at Maria's response. *"Maria, the idea of deploying a floating research station had been yours from many years ago. We'd like your take on how we can iterate it to properly pin down the research for the discovered life on Oceana."* She said, and with an awkward smile on her face, Maria's reply didn't come to a surprise to her at all. \
**"You've lost my trust twelve years ago when you made the suggestion to alter the human genome. My existence alone is proof that it can easily go wrong, and after you broke off from Carbine eleven years ago to pursue it anyway, you've lost all the remaining hope I had for you and your research. I'm repeating myself, I'm not boarding Oceana-1."** Maria scoffed, her voice deeper than usual, echoing against the curved walls in the conference hall. Her eyes were shimmering, and even if she felt a desire to answer her lifelong question deep within her body, she knew she couldn't answer it through the help of Moondial. The scientist to the left of Petra opened his mouth, but before he was able to say anything, Maria had raised her finger to gesture him to stay quiet. **"I don't want to hear a word, Marco, from you especially."** She scoffed, now locking eyes with him. But even so, he spoke anyway, trying to relieve and settle down the increasingly tense atmosphere. *"I think there's a misunderstanding. We don't intend to mix the discovered cells with the human genome."* He said calmly, gesturing to Maria to keep her voice down a bit. Taking a deep breath, Maria complied, and gave herself a few moments to breathe properly and ease up a bit.

But before she could reopen her mouth to formulate a reply to Marco, their faces had begun to deform, and in a matter of seconds, she no longer was in the conference hall that she had found herself in just yesterday. Aboard the ARC, she had now properly fallen asleep, and her mind was sending her further down her memories, going deeper and deeper, further and further back in time, and as the world around her began to deform, she was suddenly looking down the barrel of a pistol held right before her eyes. **"This is.. oddly familiar.."** The voice in her head spoke as the details surrounding the pistol began to come into focus as well. She was standing in one of the main streets, and to her left was the dark alleyway that she had just made her way out of. The smells of her surroundings were familiar, and after a few seconds of adjusting, it finally clicked. **"Deth-Kelétam."** She thought to herself, completing the puzzle in her head, the person wielding the gun becoming the last piece to complete the centre of the puzzle. But to her surprise, her memories weren't presenting a carbon copy of the day she was actively replaying in her head. In 2076, she had met Mika and Gradient in Deth-Kelétam, what was once a Dáritke stronghold. She still had a bounty on her head at the time, and Mika was eager to claim it and cash it out with Mitch, backing it up with a pistol pressed against Maria's forehead. But with time frozen, she looked at the pistol, and instead of Mika's yellow-coloured gloves holding the pistol's grip tightly, it was a cybernetic arm, coated in a reflective black colouring. Her focus point changed, going further away from her eyes, gradually following the arm of the pistol's wielder. Mika came into view, but stood behind Gradient, who was holding the weapon instead. The puzzle that Maria felt close to solving now shattered into millions of smaller pieces. **"That's not right."** Her mind said, her voice firm. She was confident that the exact event her mind was presenting to her right now was wrong, and imagination, and finally finding herself able to break the chains she felt stuck in, she stepped to the right, into the main street that had frozen in space and time too. With each step she took, time progressed ever so slightly, and standing next to Mika, she could hear his whispers to Gradient with each single step. *"Now, pull.."* He began, the noise of the crowd surrounding the trio fading in and out with each step Maria took. *"..the trigger.."* He continued, leaving Maria completely clueless. *"..and we're millionaires."*

Standing behind Gradient and Mika, her perspective shifted once more, and with Mika suddenly disappearing out of her sight, she suddenly found herself in a more familiar place. She had returned to the ARC, but to her surprise, Gradient was still standing before her, standing in the same position, but no longer holding a pistol. Time gradually resumed, and it quickly became clear that she was holding the same plasma welder that she used aboard the **Platinum Halberd** before the accident that led up to this very dream. But with time now progressing as normal again, it was Maria that froze in place, watching her walk off into the distance to her dormitory where the rest of the Halberd's crew stayed for the time being. Gradient's cybernetic arms had gone, and had been replaced with human arms once more. But that left the puzzle that shattered just a moment ago stuck on the floor. More steps were making their way towards Maria, and to her surprise, they didn't seem to pay any attention to her standing in the middle of the walkway, and instead, effortlessly walked around her to avoid bumping into her. Her mind began to sting, the picture in her head was slowly but surely fading into place, but she couldn't pinpoint it down perfectly.

In a split second, she snapped back to her senses and shot upwards from her desk, her mind fuzzy and drowsy. Trying to readjust to her senses, she continued to stare into the reinforced window right in front of her desk. Lumen was slowly coming into view, but her mind wasn't focused on that in this moment at all. Subconsciously, she felt her hand begin to warm up, and closing her eyes once more, she saw the exact moment her mind had switched her from the main street in Deth-Kelétam towards the ARC. The memory was vivid, and she found herself replaying it over and over again, eager to discover clues, eager to discover the key to the door she was stuck in front of, eager to find the last piece to the puzzle that she had picked up from the floor. Time and time again, she looked at Gradient, only to snap back to stare at Cisila's back aboard the ARC. 

Her eyes shot wide open, and it had finally dawned upon her. **"That can't be a coincidence."** Maria thought out loud, her eyes drifting towards her hand on her desk, particles swirling wildly around her fingers, almost as if they were happy to see her come to this conclusion. Her mind continued to sting, but giving herself a few moments to ease up and breathe properly again, she smiled. She had already been struggling to figure out why Cisila looked so familiar to her when she exited the Halberd after Maria and her crew had rescued not just her, but her ship's crew and those of the Pike as well, but now, the answer seemed to be clear as day. **"They're related, somehow."** Maria whispered to herself, exhaling deeply, happy that she finally solved the mystery that had been itching the back of her head for the past few days now. **"I need to schedule a meeting."** She said to herself, having raised her voice as she stood up from the desk, scrambling together everything at once now that her mind finally freed itself up. **"I need a coffee first. This will be a long night."**

## August 12th 2096 - An intriguing ring
*"If I may ask, Dr. Limáida, I never noticed it before, but I see you're wearing a ring. May I ask where you have gotten it from?"* Sean asked kindly, his eyes darting between the ring on Maria's right finger, which was holding a fountain pen that floated above the immense stack of paperwork on the desk before the two scientists. All the data logs from the **Silver Pike** had rolled in over the past days, and with Thomas having left for the **ESA** just a few days ago, it was just Maria that had any knowledge about the Alessi Shuttles. And with only one brain available to crunch through the data, any sort of comment that broke her trance would immediately irk her. \
**"This? It's a marriage ring."** She sighed, her eyes remaining fixated on the blueprint of the Pike's B-deck, before she laid the pen on the table and held up her hand before her, allowing Sean to get a proper look at it too. **"Our 22nd anniversary would've been in a month."** \
*"Would have been? Is it wrong for me to assume your partner was Dr. Vanhuyt?"* \
**"Very wrong."** Maria immediately replied, her eyes returning back to the sea of documents before her. Picking up the pen once more, she did her best to get her focus back, trying to stow away the comment that Sean had just made. \
*"My apologies, Dr. Limáida, if I said something out of line. But how come we've never seen your partner at the ARC?"* Sean asked kindly once more. Even if his questions were sincere and meant with no ill intent, it still struck Maria the wrong way, and with her ears now laying flat on her head, Sean could already feel that it was going into the wrong direction. \
**"She died 21 years ago, Sean."** Maria replied after a few moments, her voice deeper than usual, as if she was trying to suppress herself from lashing out. For a moment, she kept her mouth open, wanting to say more, but instead choosing not to. But on the other hand, Sean could hear her voice tremble ever so slightly. *"I'm deeply sorry, Dr. Limáida, I was not-"* \
**"Sean, please, you don't need to be this formal to me."** Maria interrupted him, sighing deeply afterwards while closing her eyes and facing the table. Slowly but surely, she pressed her pen down on the table and rolled back in her chair before getting out, not taking a look back at Sean's now-worried face. **"Please read through the Pike's black box entries from 14:00-17:00 and mark down any abnormalities for me to inspect. I need a moment for myself."** She said before stepping out of the sliding door, leaving Sean by himself to continue today's research. 


## August 13th - VIOLET
Coffee held in hand, facing beyond the reflection in the glass window before her. In the distance, the blinking lights of the ASA's space station could be seen, but much further beyond that, only darkness and the faint vibrance and luminescence of the neighbouring stars could be seen. A deep sigh exited her lips, and she squinted her eyes, her brows furrowing. The mug was raised once more, and it wasn't long before the rim met her lips, guiding the coffee info her mouth, the bitter taste of the unsweetened, straight black coffee costing her tongue. It was a taste she had gotten used to many, many years ago, and even though the bitterness was something that half her colleagues abhorred, she knew no different. 

*"Daydreaming again, commander?"* An older, raspy voice rang as it followed footsteps that led towards her direction. A warm smile appeared on her face as the rim of her mug left her lips once more, and turning around, she faced Harold Kreuzbauer, the veteran captain and commander that had boarded the Golden Bow together with her during the rescue mission of the Alessi Shuttles. **"More or less so.."** Maria smirked back, her mug now held in both her hands at her waist level, her shimmering but tired eyes meeting the worn-out ones of Harold. **"There's a crew member I haven't been able to get my mind off."**
Harold's eyes opened in surprise, but a faint smile appeared on his face. *"I noticed, I may have an idea as to who."*
**"Your gut feeling is probably right. It's Cisila I can't wrap my head around properly."** Maria concurred as her eyes averted to face the laminated floor beneath her feet. 
Harold raised an eyebrow, and noticing this, Maria continued to explain, a worried expression forming on her face. **"Decades ago, during one of the assassination attempts on my life, I was approach by two young people, about the same age as I was then, who held me at gunpoint. They claimed there was a bounty on my head they wanted to claim, but I talked things down, and instead discovered that they were looking for remnants of the old American Ultima project."**
Harold nodded, but struggled to connect what the story being told had to do with the fact that Cisila had been on Maria's mind all this time. 
**"I'm getting to that part.."** Maria smiled, her tired, green eyes looking into those of Harold. **"The person holding me at gunpoint was.. I think his name was Mika."** She sighed, envisioning the situation unfolding in her mind once more, quickly distorting into the more surrealistic vision she had a few days ago. **"The girl standing next to him, though, her name was "Gradient", and she looks identical to Cisila. Not in a way of being a cousin, or a mother-daughter way."** She sighed, facing the floor once more. **"It's a carbon copy of her. And I can't figure out why. The only logical explanation is that Cisila was cloned from Gradient, but by itself, that's illogical."**
Harold opened his mouth and raised his hand, intending to say something, but instead moved his hand to rest on his lips, pondering for another moment. 
*"SOLARdawn's done more odd things in the past.."* Harold muttered under his breath, his voice muffled by his hand against his mouth. *"But then again, I've only heard, I don't know the extents of Ultima and it's projects."*
**"Cloning with Ultima is outright impossible."** Maria interrupted Harold, firmly, but politely. **"Neither do I know the extents of Ultima, but if I had to listen to the voice in my head for once, creating a carbon copy isn't possible."** She paused for a moment, and moving a hand from her mug to her lips, she thought twice about her words. **"At least, not proven so.. but even then.."**

## August 14th 2096 - Self-reflections
Years, it must have been since the very last time her mind had crossed it. It had already been almost twenty full years ago that she had last even thought about it at all, but seated in her dormitory behind her desk, she rested her head on her hand and twirled her pencil between her fingers in her other hand. A short glance to her left gave her a more proper look at the strands of hair that had fallen before her left eye, and staring at them intensively, she watched her natural brown discolour into a more pale
