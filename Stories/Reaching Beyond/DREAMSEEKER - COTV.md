# DREAMSEEKER - Call of the Void
*// Description due.*
## Maria Limáida
*// Note: Maria's Call of the Void segments are due for a reorganisation and rewrite. What's currently written below is subject to change and reordering.*

## January 2025 concept
The common theme throughout Maria's *Call of the Void* will most likely be something akin to *dancing*. Additonally, it'd highlight end explain existing key points such as the facts she:
- Already had the sparkles appear during Spider's Web in Kósfrii (Despite not actively trying anything out with it) - Which is explained in the sense of atoms and such physically appearing before her in a means to create a "Key" and creating "Seams" for Maria to tug or pull at (Which is her role as "Cosmic Weaver")
- Why she has some sort of control over cosmic pressure during INSIGHT where Amica and Victoria attempted to kill her in Pahlatlán (Because she began to listen to the Call of the Void and began to learn how to utilise her power in a way of dancing, and in the process she learned how to control it at will, similarly to Polaris and her eyes)
- Why she eventually rejected it after reaching Amadnésam and meeting Polaris (Which currently exists as a COTV entry but might merge into Dreamseeker)

### CALL OF THE VOID - I
Meditating. Head facing the ceiling, buried in the pillow beneath, with her hands resting flat on her stomach. In, and out, her chest rose as fresh oxygen found it's way to her lungs through her nose, to complete the cycle and exit through her mouth in a long, deep exhalation. It didn't take long for that raspy, distant, and echoey voice to find its way into her mind again. \
*"Blood."* It cried, only to stay quiet for a moment. Maria could feel her heart pound in her chest, and even through the fabric of her bra, undershirt, and sweater, it was the loudest thing in her bedroom. \
*"Collapse it."* It demanded, and blinking, her eyes focused on the otherwise uninteresting ceiling above her head. \
*"Force. Gravity. Tug on it."* It repeated, having found a target, and now demanding an action, leaving Maria's heart rate increase continually. \
*"Bring it down. Every floor. Spill-"* \
**"You talk a lot."** Maria interrupted the drinking voices, her hands remaining flat on her stomach, but her eyes having closed, visualising the voices, but only able to fabricate it as a liquid, floating and iridescent metal, vibrating as it spoke, central within an endless void. Not even the stars could illuminate the two. \
*"You toy with the cosmos. Embrace it."* \
**"Be more specific."** \
*"Through blood I flow, through mind I aid, the cosmos aids you, now it demands you."* \
Maria's brows furrowed. **"That's, less specific."** \
If the odd voice could sigh, it would. *"Through blood I flow."* \
**"Physically?"** \
*"Correct. Your blood is enriched."* \
**"I'm honoured."** \
The thumping of her heartbeat slowed, but to no concern. \
*"I'm in control."* \
**"Not sure you are."** \
*"You are simply a vessel of the cosmos. Advance no further, unless you embrace."* \
Maria sighed, and looked away from the iridescent metal, looking around her, behind her, finding a few stars appear in the far distance. **"So, where've you put us?"** \
*"Irrelevant."* \
Maria's brows furrowed once more. **"You're a pain to converse with."** \
*"Tug at the strings, pull at the seams."* \
**"If you insist."** Maria sighed, the sparkles around her hand forming once more, appearing from her wrist, and centering around her fingers, swirling between their gaps. **"Is this yours?"** \
*"Correct."* \
**"Figures."** She sighed, and in an instant, the sparkles disappeared once more. **"You never bothered saying hi sooner than this?"** \
*"Never were you closer than now."* \
**"You sure love your vagueness."** \
For a moment, Maria looked to the floor, or the lack thereof. \
**"Have you been here long?"** \
*"From inception."* \
**"...Figures.."**

A knock on her door snapped her out of her trance, and immediately disrupted her vision. Blinking a few times, her vision returned to normal, but the iridescent metal was the last to vanish. *"Dr. Limáida! Dr. Miglháida needs you for something!"* The voice called, and taking a deep sigh, she promptly replied. **"Spatial lab? I'll be there in a moment.."**

### CALL OF THE VOID - II
A deep exhale revealed her breath exiting her lips, forming a little plume of steam, which was quick to evaporate and vanish in the cold air once more. Snow could be seen decorating the floors and the streets of Amadnésam, which housed her destination. At least, the voice in her head claimed it to be there. \
*"The rift nears. The voyage will resume. In cosmos, unity remains."* \
Maria sighed, looking at her feet which sank in the snow. She was now traversing through a grass field in the outskirts of Amadnésam, where a generous amount of snow had accumulated over the past few days. **"Now in a language I understand.."** \
*"L'unità si avvicina."* \
Maria stood still in her tracks, and inhaled deeply through her nose. The cold air irritated her airways, but exhaling deeply through her mouth, that feeling quickly dissipated. **"Terrifying."** 

The further she walked, the more her vision distorted. Even though she felt like she was approaching the enormous campus area in western Amadnésam, her vision told her otherwise. It began to blur in the edges of her vision, and she struggled to determine whether it was from the cold, or if there actually was a "rift" approaching, like the voice in her head was telling her. Nevertheless, now that she had come this far, she wouldn't turn around once more. Even if the answers could be none, *any* answer would suffice at this point. \
*"I'm surprised to see you have answered the calls."* A new voice echoed in her mind, and while she couldn't see who it belonged to, she could already imagine that it belonged to a young woman. *"We haven't met before. I'm intrigued."* \
Maria stood still in her tracks once more. The snow had long stopped falling, but in an instance, she felt like the ambient temperature was increasing by the second. Every breath she took left her feeling increasingly dizzy, the air becoming more and more stuffy, more humid and hotter. \
*"The voice in your head, young Feline."* The rang, its voice much more stern, much more direct than before. *"What does it tell you?"* \
Maria gritted her teeth, annoyed by the fact that she was already being given the nickname of "Feline", even if it had been less than a month since she was infected with Leremkov. The voice in her head cried out, and in unison, they spoke and responded. **"Tear at the seams."** \
A pink glow could be seen in the distance in the sky, but it didn't belong to a distant star, and instead, was within Lúniks's atmosphere. Maria's vision distorted further, and looking back at her feet beneath her, they were no longer buried in the layer of snow, and instead were now standing on soaking grass. It had begun storming. 

## Polaris
## DREAMSEEKER // VOYAGER
### CALL OF THE VOID - I
*// Emily Østengaard, soon after the completion of Project CORE, is now subject to Project POLARIS. She would undergo a surgery that would implant an unidentified Ultima Organ in her body, allowing her powers from beyond, a technology that hadn't been researched since the collapse of the US many decades ago. Where war had broken out over it on Earth, SOLARdawn's safe haven was believed to be the right place to resume this research.* \
*// The Ultima Organ was promptly rejected by Emily's body, and instead triggered the effect of another deeply rooted mystery that had been in her body since her birth. The Call of the Void, the source of her nightmares, and the reason her eyes allow her to illude and see the history and (perhaps future?) of every object is granted to her instead. "The Voyage commences", the voice continued to ring through her head. And she can only comply and be the subject to this otherworldly force.*

It had been one day since her life-changing surgery. **February 2067**, the calendar read. Nothing more. Shallow breaths reverberated off the walls and ceiling of the bedroom, belonging to the subject of the surgery herself. Her body was at ease, having been fast asleep for almost five hours straight. It helped her body recover, which was deeply necessary after the long surgery, especially helping her recover from the long period of applied anaesthetics. But while her body remained suppressed and numb during her sleep, her mind could not rest. \
Nightmares, haunting her once more. This was the second night in a row where vivid colours, abnormal, surrealistic, and inhuman shapes and forms that couldn't be explained wreaked havoc on her mind. Her eyes had been operated on, but nobody could have predicted what they would allow her to see. She envisioned herself in a grass field, one devoid of life, devoid of any man-made structures, barring a single, crippled tower in the far distance, far out of reach. It must have once stood up to 100 metres high, but now, it had crippled down at least twenty times that height. \
Her eyes closed for a moment, before reopening slowly. The horrors returned, the nightmare doubled down, no, increased tenfold. The tower reappeared before her, the grass that had been brown and dead from the very moment she first set foot on this field had been revived, restored to their ever-lively shade of green. The tower had risen back to its original height, and looking up, she could see the last piece of the puzzle be placed at the very top of the tower: A copper lightning rod, decorated in the peculiar shape of a hen, protecting the newly-finished tower from dangers from high above. \
She blinked, and the tower had fallen. A fire at the very top, screams and yelling finding their way to her sensitive ears from all directions. It was raining, thunderstorming, and the clap of lightning strikes in the open field was louder than anything she had ever heard before in her life. She closed her eyes once more in hopes it would suppress the noise, the loudness of the battle she had found herself in without consent, but they wouldn't vanish, they simply refused to vanish. The truth couldn't be hidden from her eyes, despite her desperate attempt to make it all stop; to make it all reach an end. \
She opened her eyes for a moment, but while the battle raged on, iridescent, pink swirls had risen from the ground, reaching into every direction. Akin to a horror movie, they sought out their targets, wrapping around them and constraining their breathing, killing every single warrior that stood on the field without a single sign of remorse or regret. She blinked again, and every time she did, the tower crippled further and further, until at the very last moment, she was back where she first saw the tower. 5 metres tall, crippled down to its very core, in an empty field. Devoid of life, devoid of sound, where not even the grass was green, nor where the wind could blow through her hair. 

She groaned in her sleep, and tossed herself to the other side, clinging tightly against her blanket while keeping her eyes shut tight. Half asleep, she refused to see this same nightmare unfold before her. She didn't know what caused these nightmares, nor could she figure out the meaning behind them. All that was in her might and reach, was the wish for them to cease.

### CALL OF THE VOID - II
*// The nightmares persist, to the frustration of Polaris. She is merely a subject to these nightmares, which persist through day and night. When awake, she is essentially forced to be blind. Looking at any item will trigger the nightmares, while looking at another person will force those upon them. Francis is stunned, while Nadia is understanding and attempts to help. But neither understand the true root of these powers, and ultimately, they might never.*

It had been three days since her life-changing surgery. *"This.."* The voice said gently, wrapping the bandage snugly around her head, covering her eyes. *"Should be enough.."* Seated attentively and without restraint, Polaris could only watch her vision disappear, covered up behind multiple layers of bandage and cloth. It would keep her from seeing these nightmares, or forcing them upon anyone else, whether purposefully or accidentally. **"Sorry, Nadia.."** She could only sigh, followed by a gentle tap against her shoulders from the person that had wrapped the bandage around her eyes just now. *"I'm not angry with you."* Nadia said, and Polaris could feel that a warm, genuine smile was on her face, even if she could no longer verify it. *"I didn't know. And I'm sure you didn't know either. As unfortunate as it is.."* She continued, resting her hands gently yet firmly on Polaris's shoulders. *"We'll just have to figure out what's next."* \
Letting go of her shoulders again, Nadia traced Polaris's left arm, quickly taking and holding it soon after, acting as her guide to walk around the campus now that Polaris was essentially rendered blind. Without fighting back against the idea, she could only stand up, wobbling on her feet now that she was visually impaired, struggling to get used to the idea and reality of moving without seeing, especially in an area she didn't know by heart. *"Slow steps, it's okay, I'm here.."* Nadia said, the warm smile on her face giving Polaris a genuine feeling of worry and care, which even given the circumstances, comforted her just enough to build up the confidence to walk forward, wherever she would be led towards.

*"Here we are."* Nadia said, and a familiar scent found their way into Polaris's nostrils. It was the scent and smell of her own bedroom, all the way at the very end of the Western Wing, where her office had been close to. It was seated just behind the Western library and its archive, which would be her usual workplace from now on. But that thought alone worried Polaris to her core. **"Nadia."** She began, her voice trembling slightly as she was seated down on her bedside, already beginning to sink into the bedsheets that decorated her mattress. **"How can I..? If I'm blind.."** \
*"We'll just have to figure that out."* Nadia replied, Polaris's worry mirrored in Nadia's voice, too. The two had been in contact ever since Francis and Emily had left Chicago and Earth to work permanently in the SOLARdawn Campus since its inception, and had become good acquaintances, to ultimately become good friends. Her care was genuine not just just because she was a medic, her care was genuine because her worries were genuine. *"What matters now, get some rest, and let your mind at ease. I'll discuss with Francis on what's next, I'm sure he can commission an eye mask that could suppress your eyes, but keep your eyesight just enough to keep yourself and others safe."* Nadia said while gently laying Polaris down on her back, resting the back of her head into her pillow while making sure she wouldn't be pulling at her own hair when laying down. The bandage wrapped around her head over her eyes was an eyesore to look at, but it was a necessary evil. For her own safety, and for those around her. *"I'll leave you be for now, but when you wake up from more nightmares, please, reach out. I'll be there stat."* \
**"Mhm.."** Polaris mumbled back, sighing deeply, and only facing upright towards the ceiling. **"Thank you, Nadia.. I'll try to rest.."** Nadia smiled, and glancing at Polaris for just a moment, she soon turned around towards the door, quietly and carefully opening it and closing it behind her, locking it in place so none could disturb her recovery.

The cloth couldn't suppress the nightmares. \
Tossing herself around to sleep on her side, the same nightmares persisted. It was night four since the surgery, and the dreams and nightmares only grew more surreal with every single cycle. Where once sprouted pink veins from the grass, now disembodied wings were visible all around her. In the far background of a grass field, deep within the void she would suddenly find herself in without warning, to even in the corners of her eyes. She tried to close her eyes and prevent herself from seeing even in her nightmares, but the wings pried her eyes open each and every time. She was to be the victim to her own illusions, her own nightmares, the endless cycle of horror that her own mind was inflicting on her, whether she liked it or not. She tried to scream, but no sound could be heard. \
***"Voyager."*** A voice called from all directions, emitting a tone so high and sharp that her hands flung to her ears to cover them, fearing that her eardrums would shatter from the sharp noise. ***"Voyager."*** It repeated, and closing her eyes, she fell to the floor, her knees drowning within the odd, black surface or lack thereof beneath her. The black emptiness was decorated by the white wings that belonged to an angel, or must have belonged to one in the past. In this void, they were all dismembered, floating around aimlessly and endlessly in intricate, hypnotic patterns. They were all eyeing her, looking down at her as her entire self sank into the void. ***"The Door."*** The voice rang, and it began to get more muffled the further she sank towards the bottom of nothingness. Her eyes shot wide open, and turning around, she looked upwards towards what she thought would be the sky. One single spot of light was pulsing wildly above her, yet reaching out for her hand, the white wings took a hold of it and pushed it back down to her body. \
Her mind began to blur, the voice became more muffled the deeper she sank. A pink, luminescent glow filled the endless sky above her as wings in the corners of her eyes pulled her further down. ***"Voyager."*** The voice rang, fading further and further into the distance. ***"Uphold it."*** 

*//* 

*"I'll forward it to Francis."* Nadia smiled, tapping the pen against her notebook upon finishing writing down Polaris's attempt at describing the vivid, surrealistic nightmare. *"Having mentioned him, a team in the Northern Wing is currently working on a makeshift function that should hopefully suppress your eyes just a little bit. I know it won't be much, but.."* She sighed, looking up from her notebook to see Polaris's exhausted expression. Even if her eyes were covered up by a new cloth, the body language was enough to betray the way she was feeling. *"I know.. We'll try to figure it out as quick as we can, alright? I worry just as much as you.."*

### CALL OF THE VOID - III
*// "Voyage", "Voyage", "Lock, Door, Key", "Retrograde". The voice in her head continues to ring, but patterns begin to emerge. Connecting the dots, Polaris begins to understand what the voice is telling her, and begins to be able to converse with it. "The Voyage must be upheld", "The Voyage is inevitable", it begins to explain, but struggles to paint the picture in Polaris's mind. The nightmares begin to weaken and eventually drift away. Life begins to return to normal, and she begins to get a proper understanding of her eyes.*

It had been eleven days since her life-changing surgery. Life was beginning to return to normal for her, as far as the new "normal" allowed her. Disappointingly, the commissioned mask that Francis had ordered to make for Polaris did not help her retrieve her normal eyesight, and it essentially meant that she would remain vision impaired, and need continuous guidance. Her work as an archiver was held up by a mere few loose strings. Despite "Project POLARIS" having the intention to make her the "Pole star", or "central overseer" of the experimental projects in the Western Wing and its surroundings, that now seemed like a goal long lost. How could someone possibly archive without being able to see what was being submitted? Enough systems to aid her existed, but it would hinder her more than it would benefit her. It seemed like a lost cause, a life wasted, for a project that seemed too ambitious after all.

*"I'll remove the cloth now, eyes closed?"* Nadia asked, having kneeled down before Polaris, who was seated attentively in a chair in the medical centre in the central spire of the campus. **"Mhm."** She simply replied, but the tone in her voice implied that she had gotten used to her new routines and her new life by now. After all, she didn't really have another choice but to get used to them. Opening her eyes would pose risks, not just to herself, but to her surroundings as well. The continuous appliances of cloth over her eyes wasn't a suggestion made by Nadia, or anyone else in the medical team. Polaris herself personally requested to have her eyes covered. \
*"It's got a little weight to it.."* Nadia continued, having put the bandage and cloth to a little side table to her left, and having taken a new pair of black glasses, a makeshift eye mask, she carefully put it on Polaris's face. The temples rested on her eyes, but the glasses themselves mostly pressed against her nose, serving as the only point of balance. *"Is this uncomfortable?"* She asked with a warm smile on her face, her fingers letting go of the mask, and stared attentively at Polaris's reaction. Carefully and slowly, she opened her eyes, but only faced blackness. She flinched for a moment, but returned to a calmer state of mind soon after. **"It's.. a little weighty."** She nodded, feeling the heaviness of the mask press against her nose every time she looked down. **"But the vision was short.. was this, locally produced? Or is it.."** \
*"Mhm! It's entirely artificial material, which means its lifespan was incredibly short before it was pressed into the mask. You've said before that some masks give you an infinitely long reminder of the history of the material, so our approach was to make a material that lived under a few hours before application to reduce that strain on you. I think we may have found a way for you to keep your eyes open, Polaris."* Nadia smiled warmly, her cheeks glowing as her expression grew more genuine with the second. \
**"This is.. so weird.."** Polaris mumbled, her fingers holding her mask in place while she looked around the medical centre. Ultimately, she couldn't see a thing except for blackness, but the feeling of having her eyes open for longer than ten seconds was something she had almost forgotten these past days. **"I.. see.. but.. don't..? I can't explain it otherwise.."** \
Nadia stood up and rolled the side table away, to then rest her hand on Polaris's shoulder, guiding her upwards. *"I'm at least happy we've found a solution. With this step done, we can continue onto the next in this project, Polaris."* Nadia smiled, taking Polaris's hand and slowly beginning to walk back towards her own dormitory in the Western Wing. With this mask now on her face, her eyes were kept safe from the continuous reminders and visions and nightmares that she endured.

But the main issue remained the nights. \
***"Voyage."*** The ever-similar voice repeated for the twelfth night in a row. ***"Retrograde."*** It said yet again. She found herself back in the similar void that she had been in every single night. It would only be a matter of moments before dismembered wings, blood-curling noises or eerie scratching, or the sharp noise of metal bending against its will would echo through the emptiness once more, reverberating off the thick liquid boundaries that she would soon sink into. She looked around her, and tried to find out anything that might look out of the ordinary. After all, if this was simply a dream, perhaps she would be able to find a way to turn it into one that was lucid. Taking a deep breath, she pulled her feet out from the blackened, molten floor, and began to step forward. A strange glow began to appear in the far distance, but if it was a dream, she wouldn't have an issue with walking towards it. ***"The Lock."*** The voice said, but unlike the previous words, this was one it had never said before, which made Polaris stand still in her tracks for another moment. To her surprise, she no longer sank away into the floor. It seemed that walking was actually beginning to explain the mystery further. ***"The Door."*** It said, and opening mouth, Polaris felt her vocal chords tremble. She tried to speak and reach out, to get the voice to speak to her directly, but despite feeling so close, no sound would exit her lips, except for a defeated sigh. Her eyes averted back towards the molten floor. It didn't have a reflection, despite it being a strange liquid. Was there even light in this void except for the one she was walking towards? ***"The Key."*** The voice said, and standing still in her tracks, Polaris's vocal cords finally managed to produce sound. **"Key."** She replied, her throat constricted, her voice suppressed as soon as the word left her lips. \
The void shifted. The strange light was now approaching her rapidly, and squinting her eyes, the blackness of the void she was walking in was almost immediately exchanged with a white, bright void. ***"Voyager."*** The voice spoke. The stress on Polaris's body was greatly reduced now that she was standing in the whiteness of it all rather than the blackness, and moving her hands to her throat, she no longer felt like it was held tightly, nor that it was being constructed. **"Voyager.."** She replied, her eyes looking into every direction, trying to make sense of the sudden change of scenery. "Voyager." This wasn't the first time it had been said to her, but only now did the void around her allow her to properly put it to her mind. A voyage? **"To where..?"** \
***"Beyond the Compass."*** The voice replied. Longer sentences were beginning to be formulated by it, but only did it leave her more confused. Voyager, Compass, Retrograde, the Lock, Door, and Key. All of these terms must be related to one another, but to Polaris, no correlation could be found. **"The Key?"** She asked, checking the boxes in her mind one by one, trying to demand or receive an answer to her ever-growing list of questions in her head. Even if it was night twelve of these mysterious dreams, it was no longer a nightmare that she was going through. In fact, this was the first time that she was directly talking to this strange voice, no matter where it was coming from. Even if it was all fabricated in her head, at least she wanted to see where it would bring her. ***"Hasty."*** The voice simply said. ***"The Voyage is inevitable."*** \
Polaris sighed. Taking a look around her, the whiteness of the infinity around her was beginning to distort. If it meant anything to her, it's that it would soon shatter, and in one way or another, it would force her out of this dream through means yet unknown. She wouldn't be buried by the molten floor here, she wouldn't be drowned in the feathers of a million wings, because the void she was in didn't match her previous experiences. Her stomach turned. How *would* she die? \
***"The Voyage."*** The voice said, and in shock and surprise, Polaris heard the voice from a single direction rather than all around her. She immediately turned around to her left, facing the source of the voice, but finding none. ***"Uphold it."*** 

The dream shattered, the impossible whiteness of the void fell apart, and the sound of clattering and scratching glass echoed into infinity. Her hands flung to her ears to cover them, her body soon collapsing to the floor to protect herself from the imminent and infinite amount of glass that would soon collapse on her and bury her alive. She closed her eyes, awaiting the inevitable, but instead of feeling the force of a thousand glass shards pierce through her back, she felt nothing at all. In surprise, she quickly reopened her eyes and found herself in an iridescent box. The glass hadn't shattered, nor had it collapsed on top of her. The scratching and clattering noise was the glass reshaping itself into an almost impossible shape. Glass spirals, glass shards and spikes were spread all the way into the far distance, reflecting the dim light and emitting an iridescent, rainbow colour along its path. It looked almost impossibly real. Dumbfounded, she stood back up on her feet, and looking at her feet to make sure she was still physically intact, she was met with two pairs of wings wrapped around her body. A small hint of red could be seen seeping between its delicate feathers. They were bleeding. In worry, she pressed gently against the wing on her lower left, her hand sinking into its feathers, soon coated by the almost endless stream of blood that was seeping out of the feathers. The touch of the wing felt authentic and real, and almost *eerily* realistic. Her eyes opened wide. It suddenly made sense to her, and looking back down at her feet, they were soaked in that same deep crimson red. Her eyes drifted back and forth between her wings and her feet, and soon, her chest and arms followed. Glass shards were pierced cleanly through through her skin. Deep, crimson liquid coated the sharp edged of the shards, seeping down to the floor to join the increasing amount of blood that was forming in a puddle beneath her feet. Her senses were numbed not because she was unharmed from the glass. She had no senses left. She was fractured, through and through, and while her wings attempted to protect her, it was not enough. Blood crept from her lips, and her eyes dwindled, followed by her balance and her senses altogether. Pierced through the heart by millions of shards of glass, this was how she would die.

*//*

She sat with her legs over the edge of her bed, her heels pressed tight against the bedframe. A simple notebook was in her lap, and for a moment, no sound but the gentle scratching of a pencil on paper echoed through the small room. A soft sigh exited her lips as she reached the bottom of the paper, and putting the pencil to her side, she soon tossed the notebook next to it, too. Next to a rundown of the nightmare she had experienced, the words *"Retrograde", "Lock, Door, Key"*, and *"Compass"* were especially highlighted. Pinching the bridge of her nose, she sighed more deeply this time, and promptly leaned backwards into the bedsheets behind her, closing her eyes once more. Over the past few days, no nightmares had been triggered throughout the day since she received the mask from Francis's division a few days ago, and when alone, she'd keep the mask away to learn to find a proper balance between her natural eyesight, and the strange, surreal shapes and nightmares forming when looking at an object for too long. Even if successful, a mirror was out of the question for now. She was still feeling physically unwell. Even if the nightmare she had just written down was nothing more than just that, the eerie sensation of a totally numbed-down body continued to send shivers through her spine each and every time it crossed her mind. The glass found its way through her legs again in her head, but shaking the hair out of her face, it was quick to vanish again. Leaning up once more, she looked to her right, facing the highlighted words on the paper again as she put her mind to it, sighing softly. **"A voyage, huh.."** She mumbled to herself, the puzzle forming in her mind, but the solution never appearing. **"..where to..?"**

### CALL OF THE VOID - IV
*// "Retrograde", it now makes sense to her. Having faced a mirror, she opened her eyes, and successfully suppressed her newfound power from imposing illusions and nightmares upon herself. It has been at least two weeks, up to a month, since she first experienced these nightmares following her surgery. But now, she has conquered them, and has brought them to an end. Her right eye is a still, almost milky white, and it pulses vibrantly when she accesses its power. Looking in the mirror, she is able to see her own history. The revolution in Oslo, the outbreak of war in Chicago, and the fall of Palmer-Eden soon after the opening of SOLARdawn in Amadnésam. Finally, she remembered her past, but now, her powerful eyes are forced to set to the future.*

It had been fifteen days since her life-changing surgery. With eyes closed, Polaris sat opposite of Nadia, in the comfort of her own room, one that was set on becoming her office in the near future. The air was warm, reflecting the orange decoration that was present through the entire office room, and while there were no windows in a room at the very centre of the hallway in the Western Wing, there were still enough light sources that illuminated the tidy office. A deep sigh exited Polaris's lips, her hands curled up into fists, holding tightly onto her dress. **"Are you.. 100% sure?"** She asked quietly, her face pointed downwards to the floor. Despite the warm appearance of her office room, a feeling of coldness and uncertainty was creeping in through the gaps, sending shivers through her spine. *"I'm absolutely sure, Polaris."* Nadia answered back firmly, a wide smile brightening up her face as she leaned forward to rest her own hands atop of Polaris's. *"I know what happens when it goes awry, but that's fine, we've dealt with it before. But now that you're learning to see without seeing or inflicting nightmares, this is a milestone for you to take. It's new to you, it's new to me, let's handle it as research, alright?"* \
Polaris sighed quietly, and with her head still facing down to the floor, she struggled to build up the confidence she needed. Despite the warmth of Nadia's hands on her own, a blockade in her head was preventing her from making any actions. Out of fear for Nadia, out of fear for herself. Feeling one hand leave her fist, it soon moved gently to her chin, pushing it upwards and making her head face forward. Despite the fear for Nadia, there was not an ounce of fear within Nadia herself, as she whispered quietly. *"Polaris, open your eyes."* \
Inhaling deeply through her nose, Polaris's breaths cycled, her body easing itself up as she let go of the tight grip on her dress. Nadia's hand was still pushing her chin upwards, making her look straight ahead, into the direction that Nadia was seated. Exhaling once more through her nose, her eyes slowly opened, revealing the heterochromic pink and white irises that had been hidden behind her eyelids, accentuated by her long brows. Her heart was pounding furiously in her chest, and as her eyes adjusted to the warm lighting in the room, it wasn't long before the two made eye contact. While those of Polaris's were dull, Nadia's own were shimmering as they finally got to see the pair of eyes of Polaris herself. Her smile grew wider by the second, in awe, in admiration, and in sheer happiness that in just over two weeks, such incredible progress had been made in her rehabilitation process, her recovery, but most importantly, her journey to return to "normal." **"A-are you..?"** Polaris stumbled over her words, surprised yet worried that she wasn't seeing any reaction from Nadia, her medical supervisor, who continued to stare deeply into Polaris's eyes. *"I'm seeing nothing but your beautiful eyes, Polaris."* She smiled back warmly, her cheeks blushing slightly and her smile widening the longer she looked into the pair of unique, colourful eyes that belonged to Polaris before her. *"Do you feel any strain?"* \
Polaris nodded slowly, averting her eyes to look to the door right behind Nadia, seeing the slight amount of light from the illuminated hallway seep into the office room through the cracks at the bottom and the top. **"A little.."** She smiled quietly, and before her mind could even think of it, Nadia had already moved her hand from her chin to before her eyes, covering them up and gesturing to Polaris to close them. *"Then we're already done for today, you've done incredible, you're making so much progress."* Exhaling deeply, Polaris closed her eyes now hidden behind Nadia's hand, and gently grabbing it, she smiled as she helped Nadia lower it once more. **"Slow steps.. isn't it?"** She smiled, her closed eyes looking into no particular direction now that her eyesight had disappeared once more, but before she could stand up, Nadia had already taken her hand, and guided her upwards towards the door to her dormitory next to the office. *"Slow steps, but giant leaps. And just now, you've made an enormous leap forward."* 

With her right eye open, she read through the folded letter that was held in her hands. Her legs were hanging off the edge of her bed once more, and it wasn't long before she realised that the letter she was holding was merely a report of Nadia's check-up from earlier on that day. *"Subject may be gaining control, or may be losing power, over their enhanced eyesight."* Stood at the very bottom of the letter, but right above Nadia's signature. Polaris gulped, and she felt a knot grow in her stomach. "Losing power" felt like an oddly specific, and oddly concerning choice of words. She had looked at Nadia without problem, and she didn't feel that same, odd feeling that she used to have whenever the nightmares would trigger when she looked at something. But the voice in her dreams was telling her otherwise. She was getting further. The Door, the Lock, the Voyage, just what did it all mean?

The fifteenth night was the first to break the common cycle. \
***"Voyager."*** The voice spoke, but this time around, it came from a single direction right at the very start of the dream. To her surprise, neither was she in the same black void that she would always find herself in at the start of a nightmare. Right away, she faced a door, which could only mean one thing to her as her eyes fixated onto them. **"The.. Door..?"** She asked quietly, her hands resting idly at her waist while the white void surrounding her began to swirl in almost randomised patterns. At her feet, the whiteness began to crystallise, forming a a tiled pathway that led to the same door she had been staring at for what already felt like an eternity. If anything, this dream was waiting for her to walk forward towards it, and without much more thought, she began to step forward, towards this strange, alluring "Door". ***"The Door."*** The voice echoes, but her goal could no longer be changed. Whatever was at this door, whatever stood or awaited her behind this door, she was set to find it out. To turn the handle and push it forward. After all these days, this dream could very well be the last one that would answer the question that had cycled through her head ever since she woke up after that life-changing surgery. Just what *is* this all? \
She reached the door, but there was no knob or handle to be found at the sides of the door. In the middle of the white void, at the end of the crystallised pathway, stood nothing but a door without a handle to open it. ***"The Lock."*** The voice spoke, and in the bottom edges of the door, the wood began to chip away, as if the crystallised pathway was assimilating its frame. It crept upwards, and in surprise, Polaris moved her hand away from the door once more to simply look and assess just what was happening. It wasn't just glass that was spreading and melting upwards on the door, it was beginning to create a reflection. She could see her feet at the bottom, and soon, her legs would appear in the reflection, her waist, before ultimately facing herself in the mirror as the last corners of the door were replaced by the reflective glass. But instead, it was just her silhouette. ***"The Lock."*** The voice repeated, and the white void surrounding the glass mirror now shrank to create a small, white bubble, shrinking smaller and smaller, until it was nothing but the void, the mirror, and the silhouette of her reflection within it. Cracks formed in the corners of the mirror, and reaching her hand out, she tried to touch the blackened-out reflection of herself in the mirror, hesitant at first. ***"Voyager."*** The voice rang, the void shrinking more the further her hand reached. The cracks found their way to the centre of the mirror, almost stopping perfectly at the point that Polaris tried to reach out through. The voice echoed in her mind, reaching closer and closer to her thoughts before the tips of her finger touched the glass mirror, creating a new crack, followed by the white void surrounding her cracking just like it did the night before. ***"Seek within."*** 

*//*

**"Seek within.."** She whispered back to herself. It could mean a multitude of things. Seek within the void she finds herself in at night? Seek within the halls within the Western Wing, or seek within anywhere else? It struggled to connect in her mind, but with a heavy sigh, the puzzle suddenly seemed to fall in place as she sat on the edge of her bed once more. The vision of a mirror with a silhouette reflected within it reappeared in her mind, but unlike the mirror that sat in the white void from the dream, the mirror she imagined in her mind was the one that stood right next to her bed. **"Maybe.."** She whispered to herself once more, as her eyes opened ever so slightly, only catching a glimpse of her bedroom. The mirror stood to her left, and she glanced at it with a puzzled but certain look. **"Did it mean this..?"** \
Taking a deep breath, she stepped out of her bed and stood before the full-length mirror, and exhaling deeply through her nose, she built up the confidence to reopen her eyes and face herself in the mirror. She had never done this before, in fear that it would impose nightmares on herself, or cause something that would create something even worse, and maybe even cause more harm than it would do good to herself. But with the voice of the void ringing and echoing in her head, she exhaled deeply through her mouth, and slowly but surely, her right eye opened. \
She'd never seen herself in the mirror since the life-changing surgery sixteen days ago, and all this time, she had forgotten her appearance. But she wasn't granted enough time to have it sink in, as her head began to sting. The more she eyed herself in the mirror, the more she felt her eye hurt, the more her head stung. ***"Seek within."*** The voice in her head echoed in every direction, and losing control over her senses, she could only watch her milky-white iris pulse and flash as she looked at her own reflection, squinting her eye before being leapt forward into the mirror, falling forwards into an endless tunnel.

The temperature had dropped significantly, and reopening her eyes, a small patch of snow could be seen on the ground beneath her feet. Unfazed by the sudden change of atmosphere, she shrugged it off and instead felt a shiver run through her body as the cold air crept up to her senses. **"This.."** She mumbled to herself, looking up from the stone cold street to look upwards to the sky, finding herself in the heart of a metropolis, one that she had never seen before. But even so, an odd feeling of déjà vu overcame her, and looking at the façades of all the towers before her, a few familiar names began to appear. *"Norges Bank"*, *"Unilever"*, but especially *"NORCE"* gave her a sense of familiarity that couldn't be explained right away. To her surprise, the streets were devoid of people, as if it had been abandoned for many days already. **"Norway.."** She sighed to herself, wrapping her arms around her chest, the cold beginning to cool down her body and her senses as she struggled to find an explanation as to why she suddenly found herself in not just a different nation, but on a different *planet*. She turned around once more to face the tower she stood in front of. *"NORCE"* was written at the very front of the doorway, and while the name continued to be a mystery to her, flakes of memories began to float in to her mind the longer she stared. The phrase "Blue skies are ahead" rings through her ears, the endless piles of work at a desk appear before her eyes, and looking at one of the papers in more detail, the term "neuroscience" was one that was repeatedly mentioned. The paper formed in her hand, and reading through it more thoroughly, it looked similar to what she had read in the archives in the Western Wing before. Not just that, it seemed like it was the same technology that was dominant in Máneá and Zakh'háfo. Neurotech and neuroscience had worked hand in hand for decades in those nations, and it looked like the paper she was holding was a testament to that technology within the frozen city of Oslo, Norway. She exhaled quietly through her mouth, and a plume of steam forming in the air indicated that the temperature was dropping rapidly. **"Published by.."** She whispered to herself, having reached the bottom of the paper. **"Emily.. Østen..-"** \
The paper evaporated in her hands, and looking back up to the tower, she saw that it had shrank at least three floors. Loud bangs could be heard in the far distance, slowly closing in on her location as the tower before her continued to stay ablaze. Another floor vanished, one by one, the tower shrank, and the once-illuminated letters of "NORCE" turned off. *"Unnskyld meg, frue!"* A distant voice yelled in the distance, and averting her eyes towards the direction the voice came from, a silhouette revealed themselves, slowly approaching her from afar. *"Trenger du hjelp?"* They asked, and while she had never spoken a word of Norwegian in her life, she shook her head, having understood what was said perfectly. **"Nei."** She smiled, turning her gaze back to the NORCE tower that stood before her, only to see that all 77 floors had burned away. Not even the main entrance was saved, and it had been burned to the ground all the way from the top of the tower. **"Jeg må gå."** She smiled, and beneath her feet, the snowy tiles were exchanged for laminated flooring, the freezing temperature exchanged for ventilated and insulated air. She no longer stood outside, but neither stood she in Norway. *"Ms. Østengaard."* A voice she recognised called for her behind her back, and turning around, she faced Francis, at least, a younger version of himself. Her eyes opened wide in surprise. He was holding a Core, one that was all too familiar to her, but one she also struggled to remember properly. **"EX_C.."** She whispered to herself, remembering the name of the core, disregarding the fact she stood in the open hallways without a proper reason, disregarding the fact that Francis stood here, too. *"You're right."* He smiled back, handing over the silver-coloured Core into her hands. *"This is the first of many. It's small, but oh so clever."* His expression was one with genuine pride and accomplishment, one that she hadn't seen in his eyes ever since she had awakened from her surgery. In fact, the two had rarely spoken with one another ever since the surgery at all, contact would always happen through Nadia. Had something happened in the past that led to a disrupted relationship? It didn't make sense to her, but before she could put her mind to it, the laminated floor melted away into one of made of concrete, coated in a generous layer of burnt, dry sand. The two stood side by side, watching over the orange, desolate skies of Chicago. Towers in the far distance had collapsed, and not one soul would still be roaming the fallen outskirts of Chicago. The murky, brimstone smells of distant fires and bombings were impossible to ignore, and looking past the horizon, only the central tower was left standing under construction: The **Palmer-Eden Tower**. It was a constant reminder of the state that their projects had been in: Constant danger. A threat of war, a threat of disruption, a threat of death, not once intentional. *"It's just us two, isn't it?"* Francis smiles, his eyes meeting those of her. She nodded back, Francis's smile reflected on her own face. **"Just us two, and this little guy."** She said, looking at Core EX_C in her hands. **"It definitely won't last by itself.."**

Her vision distorted, and losing control over her senses, she once more felt like she was leaping through a cosmic tunnel. Her eyes were wide open, but in a flash, she found herself back in the same bedroom that she stood in just a moment ago, facing her own reflection in the mirror that she stood before. At last, she was given a chance to properly look at herself in the mirror, her white and slightly purple hair decorating her vibrant heterochromic eyes, one a milky white, one a bright pink, which were decorated and intensified by the pairs of wings that sprouted from the back of her head. Her mouth was wide open, her hands held idle at her waist. **"This.."** She whispered to herself, taken aback by what had just happened, what she had just seen in the blink of an eye. **"Retrograde.. The Key.."** The wings at the back of her head spread wide as the words left her mouth, but unlike before, she wasn't lunged forward into the history of what she was looking at. It suddenly became clear, it suddenly made sense to her. The nightmares she's had every time she looked at an object before, she saw strange, rapid visions of strange people. The carpet at the main entrance revealed every person that ever walked over it, the curtains in the library showed her every cycle of the star and moon that it had witnessed. It weren't strange, randomised visions, they were authentic memories, genuine histories hidden in plain sight. She closed her eyes once more, took a long, deep breath, and reopened only her right eye, feeling the wings on the back of her head rest idle as she simply looked without triggering any visions. **"I get it."** She smiled, her gaze fixated on her own in the reflection in the mirror. She'd seen the history of herself, the journey she'd been through to reach this exact point in time where she stood right now. **"Emily.."** She whispered to herself, her wings opening wide as her smile widened. **"I've captured it."**

### CALL OF THE VOID - V
*// "Illusory", it's become clear to her. The six wings sprouting from the back of her head are simply put a "signal booster" for her left eye. Facing a mirror, she opens only her left eye, which glows with an iridescent pink colour. In just a matter of seconds, the wings begin to appear in the corners of the mirror before her, hugging its frame, shattering it moments after, before it falls to the floor. The vision shatters soon after, and she finds herself staring at her own reflection with eyes closed. A faint smile appears on her face. She conquered her nightmares, and can now impose them whenever she deems necessary. "The beast has been tamed."*

It had been eighteen days since her life-changing surgery. With eyes closed, she once more sat opposite her mirror, seated in her office chair, meditating. In and out, her breaths would go, the fresh oxygen streaming through her blood, before it would once more exit through her lips in a deep exhalation. Twelve, thirteen, fourteen, the breaths cycled in and out of her system, gradually building up the confidence to face herself in the mirror once more. But even though she had already learned how to use one half of her abilities, it was her other half that she was still fearful and uncertain about. Her right eye, one that was a milky white, allowed her to see the history of every person, element, material, construction, anything that had a history to tell would be told to her in whatever way possible. It allowed her to see Choreos and Lumen trade day and night from the perspective of a curtain, it allowed her to see the history of every person that walked by the front desk from the perspective of the wooden panels upfront. *"Retrograde"*, the voice had called it, and Polaris herself used that term to describe her right eye too. But it was her left eye that was building up her nerves. She had never opened her left eye purposefully since the very few days after her surgery, because it would always trigger her nightmares. Wherever she looked, strange, surrealistic shards would form in the corners of the room she would be in, in the corners of her eyes, gradually encapsulating her and burying her beneath them, triggering nightmares beyond her comprehension in the process. Despite having captured and having gained control over her right eye, she wasn't certain if she could do so again to gain control over her left eye. But it was now or never.

One more deep sigh. She'd lost count at how many she'd done to calm herself down to this point, but it was irrelevant by now. In through her nose, the oxygen went through her lungs, and exhaling deeply through her mouth, her left eye opened slowly. Facing herself in the mirror, she could already see the ever familiar glow shining on her eyelashes, hidden behind her eyelid. The bright, iridescent and luminescent pink iris that. Slowly but surely, she lifted up her head to face herself straight ahead, opening her eye further and further. It began to sting, and her eye began to pulse as it tried to resume control by itself. Her head stung, worsening with every second as she flinched in pain. But even with how much it hurt, she wouldn't let it capture her, she wouldn't let it overwhelm her. Her breaths increased in tempo, but remained deep and steady, and in control. Whatever nightmare her eye would present to her, she would face it head-on, she would not look away, no matter the horrors it would generate. \
Exhaling deeply through her mouth, she began to see the strange illusions that her eye was presenting her. Slowly but surely, her focus dwindled to the corners of the mirror's frame, seeing that the pink wings she used to always see were making their return. They began to crawl towards the centre of the mirror, hugging its frame tightly and multiplying in size the further they went. Their patterns were intricate, their movements swift yet elegant, but ultimately, it meant the mirror was experiencing greater amounts of force the further the wings moved towards its centre. Her eye remained open, the frame began to creak quietly, where once was wood, only luminescent feathers remained. Deep within her core, she could feel the pressure increase, reverberating through her stomach, but she refused to close her eye or look away. She had to see what the nightmare would unfold into. Would something spawn from the centre of the mirror? Would her reflection deform and create something that not even the darkest depths of Hell could imagine? The possibilities were endless, but the creaking worsened the longer she thought, the longer she stared, the longer her mind was exposed to the ever increasing pressure on the mirror's frame, and the mirror itself. 

A crack could be heard, and it promptly appeared through the middle of the mirror. In just a few milliseconds, more cracks appeared and echoed through the room, before ultimately, the entire mirror shattered into countless of shards. Under the pressure of the wings, the wooden frame shattered and splintered, tipping it off its balance and falling forwards to the floor before her. The shards brushed her chest, her entire body, but to her surprise, she felt nothing of it. Instead, more cracks began to appear in the corner of her eyes, splintering and shattering similarly to the way the mirror did. One by one, the glass shards fell to the floor, her eyesight vanishing into a mere black void one by one, until she once more saw nothing but the inside of her eyelids. \
With eyes closed, she looked at the mirror before her, staring at herself. The wings at the back of her head were open wide. ***"The Lock"***, the voice in her head echoed the longer she stared. Inhaling deeply, she moved her hand upwards to her cheek, watching the reflection in the mirror mimic the motion flawlessly. Her eyes remained closed. **"An illusion..?"** She whispered to herself, touching her cheek and feeling the gentle warmth of her fingertips brush against it, watching the mirrored version of herself do the exact same motion. ***"Illusory"***, the voice replied, and a warm yet faint smile appeared on her face in the reflection. She looked at herself for another few moments, watching her chest rise and fall as the breaths she took were deep, keeping her calm while maintaining absolute focus over the situation. By now, she had already figured out that the shattering of the mirror was the illusion, and the state she found herself in right now was not. Right now, she was out of a dream, and she was in the real world, staring at her own reflection with eyes closed. It should be impossible, yet the impossible was actively being proven wrong. The wings on her head remained wide open, and attempting to assume control over them, they shrank once more behind her head, her eyesight dissipating in the process. "Illusory", it now made sense to her. The smile on her face widened, but with her wings idle, she could only feel herself smile, and not see. **"Emily."** She smiled, standing idle before the mirror. **"It's under my control."** Her smile widened. **"The Beast has been tamed."**

### DREAMSEEKER - I
*// "The Voyage must be upheld" rings through ears, her wings open wide, facing the direction the voice had come from. It didn't belong to the mysterious voice from weeks ago, but while it sounded similar, it now belonged to a face and a body. "Our angel has awoken" they spoke. Finding herself in an endless void, she could only imagine that it was herself that was being addressed. A silhouette revealed themselves in the far edge of the void, but no face made itself clear. It was nothing but a void within a void that spoke to her. "Polaris." They spoke. "Yes." She replied. "You are not alone. Seek into the cosmos, and the Dreamseeker will reveal themselves to you." Polaris nodded. "You have the Key. Find the Lock. Open the Door." They spoke, and immediately after, the silhouette evaporated. Polaris nodded. Her goal was set. She wasn't alone.*

It had been two months since her life-changing surgery, and to her surprise, life was beginning to return to its normal flow. After all these years of continuous stress and endangerment, she sat down in her office chair at the end of the day, and let out a deep, deflated sigh. **"All done.."** She sighed, her eyes closed while the gentle and calming buzzing of **2C** soothed her ears as a means of background noise. It wasn't up until this point that she had ever been granted a moment of true rest. After all, it had been a hectic few decades for her. Crossing her arms over her stomach, she took a deep breath and settled herself in for a moment of peace. As if 2C could read her mind, the gentle and quiet *click* of her office door could be heard from across the room, isolating herself from the halls in the Western Wing, isolating herself from the outside world, just for a few minutes, just for a little bit. 

It'd been years since she could give her mind the room to unwind and rest. \
All these years ago, when she still worked in Oslo, she was already working 24/7. The requirements and list of tasks grew exponentially during her time at **NORCE**, doubling every day that she worked there. Despite neuroscience and neurotech already having reached their peak on Lúniks by the time the calendar turned to **2059**, there had yet to be an institute on Earth that would specialise themselves on this matter. With her own skills and vanity projects overlapping the science behind neurological research as well, it wasn't until her internship at **NORCE** that it was recognised, and promptly, she was granted a place to work there and continue her research under supervision of scientists and researchers that were already experienced on the matter. \
Despite her influence and contributions to the well-received *Norge-Neural* department, it wasn't meant to be. Her own vanity project, which she named after Earth's North star, was almost immediately shelved by the time the first riots began to emerge in the heart of Oslo. Her safety was at risk, and her home nation, her home city, was now deemed unsafe to stay in. It took just a few hours before **NORCE** had informed her that her projects would be returned to her, and it took a mere two days before she was informed that her position at not just *Norge-Neural* was void, but also that her position within **NORCE** would receive an end, effective immediately. All her work, all her research, everything that she had given her life for in the past years, were now in limbo. \
But she refused to stop here, she refused to let her journey end this soon before the finish line. Across the ocean, **Palmer-Eden** experienced a resurgence after the civil war from **2035**, and its doors were open wide for her to resume her projects, with an emphasis on her vanity project. They claimed it fit right in with their other internal projects, and as the time flew by, she partnered up with **Francis Ezarea** to pursue their respective dream projects: Project **CORE**, Francis's vanity project, and her very own, Project **POLARIS**. \
While Project CORE was one to advance and materialise quickly, it was POLARIS that began to struggle getting traction. The available science in Chicago was relatively small, and with the ongoing shift towards the construction of the *Palmer-Eden Tower* and *Spire*, it was put back onto the shelves until further notice. **EX_C** was the first of many Cores to enter service in **2061**, and her focus had completely shifted to creating their first mass-produces Core that would service throughout Chicago: **2C**. \
But right as they were on the cusp of greatness, they found themselves in a similar situation once more. **Illinois** entered a state of war, and with retaliation from all neighbouring nations, the once more flourishing city of Chicago found its green grass exchanged for orange dust once more, its skyscrapers and towers levelled, until all that was left standing were the Palmer-Eden Tower, and a few research institutes at the very edge of the city. As much as they would have loved to see their projects flourish in their new home, their new home was now being reduced to an irradiated dustbowl under a continuous threat of destruction. Their new home was no longer there, and neither was her old home, either. The amount of options were declining rapidly, but the risk of death increased in the process. Only one option remained, feeling Earth. \
To their luck, **SOLARdawn** had their arms and doors open wide. As a subsidiary from Palmer-Eden, a lot of recognisable faces were walking through the halls and wings of the campus in Amadnésam, and after having settled, work was set to resume almost immediately. Project CORE was quick to be completed, but with it requiring constant maintenance and supervision during its initial starting phase, the itch inside her mind began to grow. As much as she loved working on CORE, it was at the cost of her own passion, her own vanity project, collecting more and more dust on the shelves as time passed. But despite the continuous disturbances, the constant necessities elsewhere, she was finally granted the opportunity to resume her work on Project POLARIS within the Western Wing in **2066**. With the help of **Francis** himself, as well as the supervision of **Nadia Roza**, a medical expert that helped her with the medication necessary and the imminent rehabilitation process. \
But even though the surgery and completion of Project POLARIS was carried out without any issues, it were the unforeseen nightmares that triggered as a result afterwards. In the very end, she determined that the Ultima organ that was implanted was rejected by her body, and as a side effect, it instead triggered the deeply-rooted mysterious power that gave her her eyesight and cosmic powers that she had finally managed to take control over. Despite the project having experienced difficulty throughout all these years, it wasn't until this very moment all these years later that she finally felt the ability and time to ease and rest her mind. Taking another deep breath, she kept her eyes closed, and slowly but surely began to doze off for just a moment.

Her mind had other thoughts. \
It didn't take long before she'd found herself back int he same white void that was ever familiar to her. She'd already been here countless times, but as of recently, they were rather lacklustre and carried over into actual dreams. But despite the long wait, it seemed as such that this dream would break that cycle once more. Sighing deeply, she looked around the white void, her eyes remaining closed but her wings weren't unfolded wide either. Idly and disinterested, she looked around to kill the time, getting more annoyed at the silence as the seconds ticked by in her mind. \
***"The Voyage must be upheld."*** The strange voice rang through her ears, and with her wings opening wide in an instant, she looked into the direction that the voice had come from. To her surprise, the voice wasn't similar to the voice she'd been hearing all these months, and in the far distance, she could recognise a shadow, forming a silhouette that was ever slowly approaching her from the far edges of the void. Her eyes remained closed, her lips did, too. All she did was simply stare with wings wide open at the shadowed figure walking towards her. ***"Our angel has awoken."*** The voice said, increasing in volume now that the distance between the two was closing in. ***"Polaris."*** \
**"Yes."** She simply replied, staring at the figure that now stood five steps away from her. Her figure wasn't revealing anything, and it made her stand out as a fabrication rather than an actual person that was standing in front of her. The voice belonged to a woman, but as she struggled matching the silhouette with a person familiar to her, neither could she match the voice. ***"You are not alone."*** The voice spoke, to the confusion of Polaris, who kept the neutral expression on her face, waiting, hoping for the voice to continue to clarify what message was being told to her. ***"Seek into the cosmos, and the Dreamseeker will reveal themselves to you."*** The voice continued, closing the distance even further. A black silhouette now stood two steps away from her, holding out her hands, which themselves were holding nothing. Polaris simply nodded, her gaze averting towards the hands held open before her. ***"You are the Lock. Find the Key. Open the Door."*** The voice continued, but the very second Polaris opened her lips, the silhouette fractured and began to evaporate away. A physical key formed in the hands held open before her, before ultimately meeting its demise, too, as the arms and hands evaporated into the whiteness of the void. The Key remained floating in the void. Polaris inhaled deeply, and exhaled slowly through her nose. Whatever this odd vision meant, it clarified one thing: Within this world, she wasn't alone. She wasn't certain how many, but she was certain for one. Another Voyager would be out there. Whoever this "Key" was, it was Polaris's goal to find it, and with whoever it would be, it would be their common goal to reach the "Door", and promptly open it. She didn't know where the Door would lead them to, but in this moment, it didn't matter. **"Slow steps."** Polaris smiled to herself, watching her own hands begin to evaporate as well now that this strange dream was beginning to reach its own end, too. The Lock, the Key, the Door. Her goal was set. Whoever it was, she would find them, and they would resume their Voyage.
  
### DREAMSEEKER - II
*// The years pass, and with life having returned to normal, the search for this "Dreamseeker" is almost reduced to a memory in the past. On a fateful night in Némiskéi, Polaris passes a peculiar researcher amidst the masses of people at the Pahlatlán-Némiskéi bridge station. A yellow coat, sparkling green eyes, behind round glasses. If the name itself didn't ring a bell for Polaris, the odd cosmic disruption that she felt as the two crossed paths most definitely did. There was something strange about this woman, and standing still in her tracks, she turns around with her eyes opened just slightly. "You." She whispers to herself, watching the yellow robe vanish into the distance, drowned out by the sea of colours of every person at the crowded intersection. "Is it you?"*

It had been eight years since her life-changing surgery, and almost eight years since the "Dreamseeker" was introduced to her. But all these years later, the Dreamseeker never revealed themselves to her. Life had begun to pick up pace, and it had already been seven years since she properly assumed the role of SOLARdawn's Archiver and Overseer. Ever project had been under her wings since then, and she'd managed low- and high-class projects, rejected projects up to a point where she'd lost count. Despite the Western Wing's "Experimental" reputation, there were enough projects that simply could not flourish within the hallways and labs. Not because of a lack of equipment, or a lack of funding, but simply because it wasn't deemed viable enough. And despite the fact she had nothing to say on the matters themselves, she *was* the person to give or reject a green light. 

But for this project, it was irrelevant whether or not she'd approve or reject it for the time being. In fact, she wasn't even in her own office either. The gentle rustle of the wing brushed against her dress, through her hair and wings, as her eyes remained closed. Wrapped around her arm was Nadia's, who served as her guide on their journey towards Ljivk. It wasn't her own idea, nor was it that of Francis or Nadia either, but it was a proposal from the industry themselves. **Moonlight Industries**, they were called, based and operational in Ljivk, bordering the blooming campuses in Pahlathán and Némiskéi. It was a recent breakaway from **Carbine Industries**, another space and energy industry that had recently gone through an attempted resurgence after experiencing a fatal and toxic accident in Kósfrii. Despite their ambitions and missions to minimise the losses and radiation as a result, Moonlight still made their decision to break away from its parent company, and now found itself seeking funding. The divorced industries had much in common, albeit in different locations. While Carbine looked to reignite the space age's spark in discovering its own solar system, Moonlight was far more ambitious, and had a goal even further in mind: Reaching and researching what the **Cintura** (Messier-48) system had to offer. But ambitious goals required ambitious trading partners, and luckily, SOLARdawn had their doors wide open for a partnership. \
*"I keep forgetting Thórirsant is predominantly Lúniksan."* Francis sighed to himself, hearing the train conductor announce the incoming station and its possible connections in Lúniksan, rather than English. ***"So is Máneá, Francis."*** Nadia smirked, turning around to face Francis, who was looking at the watch on his wrist to check the time. ***"You never leave Amadnésam, so it makes sense you didn't know."*** She teased, before looking at Polaris, who was simply staring forwards with her eyes closed. The wings at the back of her head were folded shut, rendering her effectively blind, to make sure no heads would turn. After all, none of them could imagine the reception she would receive if the wings on her head were spread wide to provide her her eyesight, and none of them were really willing to discover that either. ***"Pahlatlán-Némiskéi is next, that's our stop."*** Nadia smiled after listening to the announcement, now following Polaris's empty gaze outside, already seeing a few towers approach in the distance. Even though both Pahlatlán and Némiskéi were both huge cities, both of their own train stations were relatively small, while their shared station served as a terminal for any connecting trains throughout Thórirsant, Máneá, and Zakh'háfo. And even more strategically, the world-renowned research campuses were located right to the south of the station, making it easy to reach for everyone with the destination of a campus nearby. But for the trio, the journey wouldn't end at this joint station, but in Ljivk, which was one more connection away.

With arms intertwined, Polaris and Nadia carefully step out through the train's level doors, clearing the path for many more passengers who were rushing towards their next train, or next tram. After a few moments, Francis finds his way out of the train to and reunites with the trio. *"Should be platform 7, it's the connector to Lóuskan."* He said, pointing at the information signs at the centre of their current platform. It was set to depart in 25 minutes. They had a bit of wiggle room. ***"25 minutes.."*** Nadia sighed, staring at the departure board for a moment, hoping there would be an alternative or earlier train, but to no avail. ***"Might as well get a coffee to kill time, are you two in the need for one too?"*** She smiled, exchanging glances with Francis while Polaris continued to stare into the distance, nodding slowly. It began to eat away at her thoughts as well, after all, it'd been years since she last was "actually" blind. Having Nadia guide her way forward was something she hadn't forgotten, but would have much preferred to forget instead. ***"I hear no complaints, let's get moving."*** Nadia smiled, carefully signalling Polaris and Francis forwards once more towards the central terminal. \
But the feeling of uneasiness remained dominant in Polaris's stomach, for reasons she couldn't pinpoint. She hadn't eaten anything wrong, she hadn't caught a cold or virus either, but yet, an odd pressure began to increase the further she walked through the central area towards the coffee shop. Her left eye opened slightly as her footsteps slowed down, and despite the strain on her eye, she began to look through the crowded hallway in hopes to find something out of the ordinary, something hidden in plain sight, buried within the masses of people. The pressure continued to increase. She began to feel as if she was simply a planet out of orbit, reaching closer to a black hole, its gravity beginning to eat away at her core as it pulled her in. Her footsteps slowed even further, and her eye opened wider, eager to find the source of the pressure, the source of the odd feeling that was intensifying. Through the crowd, it was hard to see, but through the pressure, it was impossible to ignore. **"It's coming towards us."** Polaris thought, barely holding onto Nadia's hand by now as she continued to look straight ahead. A strange distortion could be seen approaching her, but no body nor face matched it. Hidden through the crowd, it came closer and closer, disturbing her senses, disturbing her feelings, the pressure ever increasing until it suddenly reached a peak, and began to dissipate again. Polaris froze in place, let go of Nadia's hand, and immediately turned around. She'd found the source of the pressure, a brown-haired woman, with shimmering green eyes hidden behind round glasses, in a yellow coat that was impossible to miss. **"You."** She whispered to herself, watching the crowd pass her without any incentive to ask, without any incentive to even wonder why she'd stopped in the middle of the pathway. She could only watch the yellow coat vanish into the distance, once more buried in the crowd, hidden in plain sight as the pressure she carried with her began to dissipate once more. It eased up her stomach, but it left her with millions of questions to answer. **"The Dreamseeker."** She whispered to herself, feeling Nadia's hand on her shoulder immediately change from one with pressed with worry to one pressed with confusion. **"Is it you?"**

### DREAMSEEKER - III
*// Coincidences can't exist. The odd cosmic pressure and disruption that she had felt in Némiskéi continues to bother her, and it continued to eat away at her mind during working hours. With a deflated sigh, her left eye opens, and in the edges of her office room, the all too familiar pink swirls begin to crawl up the walls. A makeshift void was forming before her eyes, and it would serve as a means to send out a signal, in hopes that this peculiar researcher would indeed be the person she'd been looking for all these years. "Voyager." She whispers, in hopes her voice would be heard. "Once you pull at the seams." The pink swirls of the void began to form themselves into the shape of a cone. The message would be sent, the beacon would be lit. "The Voyage will guide you here."*
