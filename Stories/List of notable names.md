# Interplanetary Travel

## ELE - Earth-Luniks Express
Soon after Luniks was first settled, it became a top priority to establish a stable and steady connection between the two planets. Initially, the travel ports were build and activated between Switzerland and Nóve Réjkjavik, with many other ports quickly being built afterwards to allow a smooth transfer of many people that had an intent to move to Luniks and help settle the young planet. Because of its rapid activation, Luniks could grow as quickly as it has.

**ELE** travels through the wormhole that's also referred to as the *Panjit Loop*, which is named after **Tagip Panjit**, who was the key factor to discovering the necessary steps towards fast interplanetary travel and enabled travel to Luniks in the first place.


# Rail Services
Each nation has their own national railway, which will slowly spring to life as this document evolves, but until then, the existing rail companies and lines are described in this section. 

Despite being set in the near future where space travel is a reality, travel by train has stayed relatively the same, albeit more dense and more important.  
  
Separate passenger and cargo corridors were created in order to make passenger and cargo transport completely independent of one another. Having survived a bankruptcy on Earth, **Railpool** has found its place in cargo transport throughout and between Thórirsant and Kérisant, maintaining a tight connection and almost exclusive use of Siemens locomotives.
## LT - Lúnikska Tren
LT as a company frequently reappears throughout the story, although it only services connections between the various nations on **Ubunia**. 

## UR - Ubunia Rail
What started as a project for sleeper trains between Jóthul and Thórirsant blossomed into a rail service that connects all nations of Western Ubunia. With a three-way format of train services, UR provides:
- **UR Express**: A high-speed service connecting many major cities between Thórirsant, Máneá, Jóthul, and Zakh'háfo, with branching connections to major terminals in Ellitróómi and Kérisant.
- **UR InterCity**: A high-speed rail service that stops at more intermittent stations, proving service and connections to many more cities, but not stretching out as far as UR Express.
- **UR Regio**: A slower service that stops at all intermittent stations, providing service to every passenger.

## RKU - Rail Klaszi Ubunia
RKU provides international services between **Thórirsant**, **Kérisant**, and **Zakh'háfo**, providing both cargo and passenger transport.

## VR - Vestia Rapid / Vestia Regio
Vestia Rapid is the high-speed train service that operates between the various nations across Vestia. Its connections range from **Hédenis** and **Mónsan**, through **Zhuehai**, **Álusken**, and **Vao**, with split connections to **Benelux** and **Denmark**. Its most known for the fatal rail incident ever since its inauguration, as described in [[Journey - Luna#SPAD (Signal Passed At Danger)]]. 

Currently planned (December 2023) is developing a brand identity for this service. Taken from the Trello board: \
*Existing concept is a slogan of “Wherever you're going, we'll bring you there”, or "Across the road or across the border, we'll bring you there." Some examples include:* \
"Whether you're going to:
- Sui Donnore
- Ippavím 
- Myriapolou
- Shánzhe
- Lëtzebuerg
- Matéiazhu

We'll bring you there."

*Alternatively, this list of examples can also be exchanged for simply a list of cities that are connected to Vestia Rapid. Next to that, Vestia Rapid can also be transformed into a general rail company, also providing a means of regional and intercity transport without incredible speeds as their VR20s. However, this might need a rebrand, and exchange the "Rapid" name for something else, such as "Vestia Regio".*

Planned is a combination of purple and grey colours with stock high speed rail footage. Just like how LT banners were proposed and created as a concept, the same process should happen for the brand identity of Vestia Rapid.

## Máneán Metro
**Máneán Metro** (Metro da Máneá) is the umbrella name for all the metro services that it provides in the various cities in what once was **United Máneá**, such as the *Álef Metro*, *Fsat-Hokh Metro*, or even the unique, single-line, *Kristensend Metro*. The one charm that all of these unique metro lines have in common, is that they're fully autonomous. In fears that there would once day be staff shortages and that some lines would end up abandoned, its government had rallied to invest into autonomous services. After the **Collapse of United Máneá** in 2039, the lines continued to service every city as normal, and continued to do so for many decades onwards.


# Ship Services
Only a couple of cargo services by ship exist throughout all of Lúniks. This is because overseas shipment has mostly been replaced by solar plane cargo.

## Álusken-Thórirsant Ferry
A ferry (rather, a cruise ship) connects the two continents of Ubunia and Vestia, providing a ferry both ways every 3 hours. 

# Research Institutes
## Hammerhead Industries
**Hammerhead** is a Vestian industry appliances manufacturer, who is best known for snowballing the expansion and normalisation of the settlement of Vestia, soon after the borders were drawn upon landing on Lúniks. 
### History
Founded in **2013**, **Hammerhead** settled itself outside of the **Zhuehai** city of **Shánzhe**. Ever since, its first and only goal was to expand as rapidly and as efficiently as possible, and enormous factories, airfields, and factories sprung up in the far outskirts of Shánzhe, giving it its temporary skyline. In **2019**, the immense construction of factories and facilities was completed. Not too long afterwards, the production of satellites and means of travel for on Lúniks was carried over to Hammerhead from the ESA. This gradual transition went through until **2031**, which was when the ESA formally handed over its facilities and control centres to be based in Shánzhe, completing the now 40-year-long mission to fully settle another planet.
### Starship development
From **2019** through **2031**, Hammerhead's primary focus was retrofitting the four existing **Starships**, modernising them as times evolved and keeping them in their best shape for frequent travel between Earth and Lúniks. Additionally, They also begun their iterations of **Four**, and developed the next generation of Starships that would serve as a means of passenger transport while the **ELE Corridor**, another Hammerhead project, was still undergoing development. After the **ELE Corridor** had been completed, they once more retrofitted the now-old Starships and the next generation of Starships, to supply the necessary cargo between the two planets for the **ESA handover** in **2031**.
### Alkéisa's Ring
From **2025** through **2037**, Hammerhead's various departments also laid their focus on developing **Alkéisa's Ring**. More info in this is available at [[Alkéisa's Ring, 2037]].
### Rail Networks
From **2018** onwards, Hammerhead had been a key factor in developing the immense rail networks that are present on the continent of **Vestia**. Next to manufacturing the trains and tracks in use by **Vestia Rapid/Regio**, it has also developed various technologies that support Maglev trains, a technology that was picked up from Asian projects. 
### Weaponry
In **2035**, four years after the **2031** handover, Hammerhead laid their eyes on producing firearms in hopes to expertise themselves in every possible field of work. Next to efficient rifles and handguns, this sparked the development of **Pulse Rifles**, a type of weapon that has become incredibly prominent since the **2050s**. These rifles were **non-lethal**, which sparked their interest as a means of self-defence. Pulse Rifles aside, they also produce an immense arsenal of firearms, ranging from pistols the size of a hand, to rifles that can make a target unrecognisable at a range greater than 3km.
#### Known Arsenal
- **HR75** (**Heavy Rifle Class 75**): A top-of-the-line bolt-action sniper rifle with expert power and precision. With a length of almost 190cm from barrel to stock, this rifle supports .50cal cartridges and a versatile platform of extensions that cater to your needs. 
- **HR62** (**Heavy Rifle Class 62**): 
- **SR43** (**Standard Rifle Class 43**): When you need a rifle that does exactly what you require it to do, the SR43 fits all of your needs, even if they frequently change. Supporting a wide variety of cartridges and extensions, the versatile SR43 has your back, wherever your mission may take you.
- **SP14** (**Standard Pistol Class 14**): (Iterated Five-seveN).
- **SP17** (**Standard Pistol Class 17**): A more nimble, lightweight, yet sturdy variant of the **SP14**, weighing less, but packing more firepower in a similar, familiar build.
- **SP9** (**Standard Pistol Class 9**) (*"Niner"*): Money shouldn't keep you from defending yourself in dire situations. With that in mind, we developed your favourite sidearm, the **SP9 "Niner"**. 
- **MPC5** (**Micro Pistol Class 5**): Don't let its size fool you. At the size of a hand, the MPC5 still delivers significant firepower.
- **PZ25** (**Pulse Class 25**): Your new best friend. Developed and iterated internally at Hammerhead for over 10 years, the PZ25 is the incredible result of endless hard work to bring you pulse weaponry in a compact, accessible form factor.
- **PZ55** (**Pulse Class 55**): (Visual reference: Apex Nemesis Rifle).
- **EPZ60** (***Experimental* Pulse Class 60**): A modern camera has a two-stop press before taking a photo, with the first stop press bringing the subject in focus. Why not utilise such a mechanic in a rifle? The **PZ60** can fire like a normal rifle, but doubles as a marksman rifle, and holding the trigger on its first stop will charge up a shot that is fired when the trigger is fully pulled.
- **EPZ90** (***Experimental* Pulse Class 90**): (Railgun prototype).
### Back to Earth
In **2052**, Hammerhead made its return to Earth, with the intention to kickstart the same snowball in technological development it had achieved during the settlement of Lúniks. But where development slowed down after the **ESA Handover** in **2031**, it couldn't reach the same level of development upon re-entering Earth. Choosing to reallocate its resources, it engaged a new partnership with the **ESA** and the Pacific development team, to discuss what would be possible on continents such as Africa, or South-America, and where more opportunities could arise.

In **2058**, Hammerhead would make a controversial appearance in the **Southern States**, coming to an agreement with the **Miami Establishment** to aid the Southern States, and its neighbouring nations of California and Central America. With this aid package, Hammerhead would continue to develop ELE connections throughout the Americas, connecting more cities and states with the rest of the world, and with Lúniks. But additionally, it would aid the Americas in military, forming notable teams such as **HEART** (*Hammerhead Extract And Rescue Team*), and **HIT** (*Hammerhead Illinois Taskforce*).

## Carbine Industries
Next to offering a varied catalogue of weapons, **Carbine** is on the hunt to reach the same level of market share that **Hammerhead** currently has. Jealous of their achievements, Carbine entered the experimental weapon department, in hopes to create a new image for themselves where they failed trying to chase after Hammerhead. 
### Beyond Limits
**Carbine** entered the experimental weapons department in **2067**, producing various concept weapons that closely resembled the strength that Hammerhead's arsenal provided, and after reverse engineering these weapons, they were set on going beyond the limits that they had found. \
In **2073**, this leads to disaster in a factory in **Kósfrii**, **Thórirsant**. In an attempt to channel power to its secret **Spider's Web Project** through the means of nuclear fusion, the nuclear reactor that provided power by more standard ways failed spontaneously. The reactor, which was located in an adjacent factory to the fusion reactor, experienced a total meltdown and in the span of **twenty seconds**, it had gone from functional to having blown out the parallel halls and sister reactor, emitting toxic radiation and creating a sea of fire that refused to be extinguished. \
The loss of life was incomparable to any previous project lead by Carbine, and in shock, their last project for the rest of the decade was to create domes for the Kósfrii and Jánhul reactors that had failed, in order to protect the remains of the reactor from emitting more radiation. 
### Invent the Unconventional
After the **Collapse of Kósfrii** and the creation of the **Kósfrii** and **Jánhul Exclusion Zones**, Carbine decided to step back from their experimental weaponry for the coming years. But with many of its employees now itching to discover and work on something new, the team in **Némiskéi** was especially eager to get back to work.

In **2076**, this leads to the creation of the **Carbine Research Institute** based in **Némiskéi**, which promptly created various research shuttles that would be launched for repeated research on the surrounding planets of Lúniks. Most notably is the **Platinum Halbert**, launched in **2093**, that has been shuttling between **Dvóniks** and **Lóivonus**, passing by Lúniks for routine checkups and interchanging data. 

By **2096**, the research that is being conducted by the **Platinum Halberd** and **Silver Pike** has been mostly directed to determining whether or not it is viable for humanity to settle **Mars** or **Dvóniks** while utilising the nearest gas planets, **Jupiter** and **Lóivonus**, respectively. Additionally, the two enormous spaceships have been test benches for various space technologies that are actively in development by Carbine, as well as giving room for other industries to utilise the existing space on the ships to commence their own research. 
#### Known Spaceships
This list has moved to [[List of Spaceships]].

## Moonlight Institute
This institute as a story component is currently in a startup stage. A proper description is due. It will most likely be placed near **Némiskéi** and **Pahlatlán** to complete the science districts. This means that the city of **Ljivk** may undergo a slight rewrite to suit this goal. \
Subsidiaries/daughter branches:
- **Moondial**: Much like **Hammerhead** and **Carbine**'s **CRI**, Moondial is a space research institute that is actively developing spaceships and -stations to conduct various means of research of the current known galaxy. While (as of **2096**) Hammerhead has been keeping its focus on commercial spacecraft and research, and Carbine has been eyeing terraforming the settled systems of **Sol** and **Choreos**, Moondial has been laying its eyes especially on **Cintura**, which had been relatively off the charts until **2095** specifically. 
- **Lightcone**: Subsidiary created to master the wormhole technologies that had been used since 1999, which would allow humanity to reach other solar systems faster, and more efficiently.
- **Starlight**: A sister company created to research the possibilities of creating a **Dyson Sphere** around either **Sol** or **Choreos**. While **Carbine**'s goals to master nuclear fusion technology already seemed overly ambitious, Moonlight's **Starlight** project would make the former seem reasonable.

## Ódóni Industries
Once based in **United Máneá**, **Ódóni** supplied the technologies that were needed for research in **Amadnésam**. After the collapse of **United Máneá**, Ódóni fled to **Rhódisz**, together with a number of other industries and companies in hopes to escape from the collapsing economy and increasing crime rates. The Ódóni tower, where the research once took place, was locked down, but since **2062**, it has been reactivated, and has since been the centre of **Neurokick** production.

## SOLARdawn
Deriving from the once-dominant Illinoisan industry of **PALMER-EDEN**, **SOLARdawn** is its next evolution in providing the public a solution for their experienced problems. With strong ties to **Leremkov** and **Alexandrie Pharmaceuticals**, SOLARdawn gained a headstart in **2064** and gripped around itself in the slowly recovering nation of **Máneá**.

## Alexandrie Pharmaceuticals
Once at the forefront of the pharmaceutical industry in Ubunia, the **Jákovy-Alexandrie scandal** in **2071** undid any sort of trust in the public that they had built up over the last decades, causing the company to destroy itself from inside out as there were no longer any customers willing enough to make use of their services. From the many decades of hard work, a single scandal from the higher-ups in charge left the company collapsing within a year. But to the researchers and staff that weren't involved, their journey wouldn't end there, and the rise of **SOLARdawn** in the same block gave them the opportunity to resume their research under a new flag.


# Common Brands
## Esti
**Esti** is a worldwide supermarket chain that originated in **Thórirsant**, and has tagged along with every new nation that sprung up ever since the settlement of Lúniks, to become the backbone of every newly developing nation. 

## Norden Supermarkets
Prominent in the north of Álusken (Hence the name **Norden**) is **Norden Supermarktir**, which have been established soon after the handover from *Queen Álusken I's* reign to that of *King Álusken II*, who then attempted to get rid of every sort of modern service since the start of his reign. In a desperate attempt to survive, Norden opened its first few markets in the south of **Vao**, and once it became clear that the plans that King Álusken II had made would be limited to within the boundaries of the capital, Norden quickly returned to the north of Álusken, where it has since outgrown its competitors.

## Swipe
**Swipe** is a cornerstore managed by **Esti** that is especially prominent in larger cities, providing a means of quick grocery shopping on the fly by being present on almost every corner on every street. (*// Depending on Gridrunner's development, it may be a fully automated cornerstore. This is still actively being developed.*)

## Bottleneck Brewery 
Troubleshooting tech, the way you know and like it. **Bottleneck** was created by two friends who were troubleshooting their home office computer, and discovered that it was being severely bottlenecked by the memory that was installed on the board. From one thought process into the next, they cracked open a beer while optimising their issue, and the rest was history.

Now based in **Kastávje**, the two friends try to experiment around with their different styles of brewing and creating various beers, but their main goal remains the same: Beer should be fun to make, and fun to taste.
