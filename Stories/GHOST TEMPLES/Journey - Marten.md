## LAST LIGHT // MARTEN  
### Dancing with Dragons
*// POV: Marten* \
It hadn't just been days that had flown by, it'd been months. Bedridden away from home, stuck at the university I once studied at, unable to do anything but watch the clocks tick away while my condition worsens. The university student I once dreamed to teach at the hospital, were now the ones taking care of me, and my dream of becoming a teacher was becoming slimmer by the day. \
My mom I had lost to cancer, my dad was in Zhuehai for his work, and with how busy he was this fiscal quarter it wasn't easy for him to visit me either, all the way in Lasz. We videocalled, and made the best of my worsening situation, but it was lonely. 

I hear a knock on my door, and the nurse who I knew as Miranda, slowly made her way into my room. **"Am I disturbing..?"** she asked, a folder of documents tucked away under her shoulder. I shook my head, and she made her way to the chair beside my bed. **"I have.. news, Marten.."** She began, her tone already giving me shivers, as I wait for the inevitable words that were soon to exit her lips. \
*"Is it bad?"* \
**"You could say.. bad. You've had a metastasis, that spread to your lungs. We could continue with our attempts at medication, but that too, could just accelerate the inevitable, Marten."**

Miranda rested her hand on my thigh, her blue eyes weren't shimmering as they usually were, and just like her, I knew that this day would one day arrive. I'd gone through traditional medication, experimental medication, but even after so many decades of advancement in cancer treatment, a rare case like the heart cancer that I was diagnosed with remained an outlier. I felt a feeling of hollowness wash over my body, I felt my eyes attempt to cry, but the hollow feeling of helplessness and imminent death prevented me from crying. I didn't know what to feel, I didn't know what to say. I had been mentally preparing for this bad news for months, but now it was finally here, it still hurt more than the pain I was already going through.

**"I'm sorry, Marten."** Miranda said, tears beginning to stream down her cheeks. She had been my personal nurse and guardian ever since I was diagnosed with cancer. We've been in contact for many years before we even went to university, and while she studied to become a nurse, I studied to become a teacher and manager in the same hospital as hers. But neither of us could ever imagine the situation that we'd find ourselves in right now. Lifelong friends, but one would be on their deathbed at 26. \
*"I-It's fine, Miranda, really."* I struggled to reply, an uncontrollable mixture of emotions roaming through my head, the memories and experiences I had made in my past years, all the way to the past months where I had been stuck in bed, doing my best to stay active in the fitness area, but more and more frequently collapsing and worsening as my heart cancer persisted and refused to go away. *"I.. guess it was inevitable."*

Miranda stood up from the chair, and gave me a tight hug, carrying over the memories we had made together, our bond that had been stable for so long, while I struggled to get the strength to hug her back the same way. **"I'll forward it to the other nurses, but we'll keep in touch like always, Marten, I'll be back in a few hours.."** She said after letting go of me again, picking up the folder but leaving one document on the desk beside me, before she would make her way back out of my room again.

And like that, the days would continue to go by, an ever-inclining downwards slope that would ultimately reach a wall, a dead end at the very bottom of the mountain I was dreaming to climb. Day in and day out, my medication would change. Higher dosages to lessen the pain that my heart and lungs were causing me, and fewer activities to give my body the amount of rest it desperately needed. I called with my dad every now and then, I would watch my other friends go out and have fun as they neared their final exams and graduations. And yet, the hollow feeling remained as my body continued to collapse within. 

**"I'll apply morphine now, Marten."** Miranda said, two months having gone by since she had told me the devastating news. At this stage, the inevitable could happen any moment. My lungs had deteriorated too far for recovery now and I had to get oxygen artificially. The beeping of the heart monitor was irregular, but stable enough for me to carry on for just a few more moments. It would make people that passed by exceptionally worried, but having endured the beeping for so many months now, I didn't even hear the noise anymore. \
I felt the syringe press into my shoulder, the morphine applying, knowing that the pain I was currently feeling would soon reduce just enough for me to call with my dad again. My friends had graduated, and were on vacation all the way in Myriakos. Since two weeks, every day had passed like this. Miranda, or another nurse, would apply morphine to lessen my pain, and I'd be taken care of almost 24/7. It was exhausting for them too, but they continued to have hope, to wait for a miracle to happen where the medication would suddenly strike luck and cause my cancer to shrink again. 

But no such miracle would happen, and I too, knew that the odds were far too low for me to get lucky enough. I turned the TV above my bed off, night was closing in soon, and the morphine would slowly begin to kick in at this stage. I looked outside, the stars and the blue-green skies of Vao were shining brighter than ever. Even with the hospital lights polluting the area, its beauty couldn't be denied. I had read about the myths of Vao and Álusken just a week ago, that the Aurora wouldn't be caused by solar flares, but by the dragons that would roam the mountains while the nation is fast asleep, emitting colourful lights with their flames that danced in the sky. 

A warm smile appeared on my face, the idea of such myths existing warming me up internally, the beauty of the world fascinating me once again. And so, I close my eyes, ready to go to sleep once more, with my pain suppressed. The beeping of the heart rate monitor always would echo through my room all night long, irregularly like normal, but tonight, it would be a single, continuous beep. \
In a hurry, Miranda rushed to my room, a quick glance at the monitor, and a quick glance at my fast asleep face, and she too knew the situation I was in. She smiled, sighing of relief, whispering softly to me. 

**"At last, you're freed from your pain, Marten."**

### Freed From Pain
*// POV: Marten* \
The vivid, colourful dreams of the Dragons of Vao seemed to reach an end. Morning was approaching, and despite being asleep, my mind and my body were both aware of this. Before long, I slowly opened my eyes, finding myself in the ever familiar hospital room that I had spent the last months in. The sun was shining brightly through my window, and it almost seemed like a totally different world without the Aurora dancing over the Vaon mountains. But something seemed off. I still felt bedridden, and looking around my room, I picked up just how eerily quiet the rest of the hospital was. I could usually always pick up at least five different voices in the hallway, laughter from the reception, distant beeping from the other rooms, but neither of those sounds were prominent at this very moment. 

I moved away the bedsheets, still wearing the same, boring white and blue hospital clothes that I've been wearing for what felt like my entire life now. But once more, I felt ticked off. *I usually have to ask Miranda to take intensive actions for me, h-how did I just do that?..* I think to myself, staring and investigating my hands and arms in awe. My heart was beating like normal, and it took me another minute to realise I wasn't being artificially supplied with oxygen. I shrugged it off as nothing, and instead, smiled warmly at the idea of a miracle actually having happened. Miranda and the other nurses always prayed for the best to happen, did their praying actually help? *Maybe I'd been in a coma, and recovered while in it.. This is surreal..* 

After another minute of doing light activity, I finally bite the bullet and move my lower body around in my bed, sliding my legs off the side of the bed with ease and without pain. Miranda would always bring a wheelchair for me to move around the hospital, my legs having deteriorated too much for me to still walk on my own, and yet, I felt confident enough in my mysterious strength that I slid off the bed, and stood on my own legs without support for the first time in months. And it felt, normal, strangely normal.

I continued to scan around my room, seeking a note from Miranda about what was going on. If I had really been in a coma for this long, surely something must have been left behind me to inform me once I woke up? But after minute of carefully stepping around my room, searching for a note or any sort of information at all, I finally take a deep breath and open the door to the big passageway, expecting the worst, but hoping for the best.

But as quick as my hopeful smile had appeared on my face, it had disappeared again as I took a first look in the passageway. It was completely abandoned, but not desolate. A strange, cold, and white mist was lingering on the floors, and every room was left alone. *A bomb threat..?* I thought to myself, the thought being the only one crossing my mind as to what could explain why the entire hospital would be left alone. It didn't seem like it was abandoned too long ago, in fact, it seemed like everyone had left just minutes before I woke up. The feeling of hope that I had desperately try to keep a hold of was finally beginning to dissipate, and taking more steps towards the nurse's office in hopes to find Miranda, I take one look behind me, my eyes meeting with a strange, inexplicable figure in the far distance. I stand dead in my tracks, my heart skipping a beat, my breath held, as the figure's voice booms through the passageway.

**"You have awoken, Marten."**

Dumbfounded and taken aback by the figure's voice, I see them slowly step towards me, realising that I was already at the very end of the passageway and couldn't easily flee if I had to. But something about this figure seemed, off. They seemed, welcoming, inviting, and understanding. Getting lost in my own thoughts at what was going on, I realised that the figure already stood merely a metre before me. Our heights nearly matched, and even if I was a centimetre or two taller than him, I still felt like he was towering above me, but I couldn't pinpoint why. 

After a minute of silence, the figure before me held his hand out for me, offering a simple, introductory handshake, to break the ice. \
**"I'm sorry if this is a sudden change in pace, Marten. My name is Vászi, the Settler of the Temple of Vestia."** \
I shook my head, shaking off any thoughts that I had in my mind, and questions that remained, and shook his hand with mine, struggling to formulate a reply. \
*"V-Vászi? Like.. the Reserve? That's.. quite the name to carry.."* \
He shook his head, and behind his mask, I could see a smile form, after which I shook my own head and smiled as well. Shrugging off the awkward icebreaker, my expression changed to a more serious one again, as I asked another question. \
*"What exactly.. is going on?"*

Letting go of my hand, Vászi took a moment to formulate his answer, and while I was expecting the worst, I was still feeling hopeful for the best answer. It seemed too real to be a dream, but it also seemed too vivid to be reality. I felt like I was floating in a limbo between the two, as if I was lucid dreaming. But even then, things were so odd, and if it was a lucid dream after all, I still felt so.. limited..

**"Unfortunately, no miracle had happened, Marten. In your last sleep, you have died peacefully."** \
A smile appeared on my face while existential confusion began to whirl around in my body. *So I finally bit the dust..* I thought to myself, wondering how I managed to survive that long with my cancer in the first place. But even so, my question wasn't answered. This seemed, eerie for an afterlife, and I wasn't religious myself either. More questions arose, and more and more doubts began to form, but Vászi cut me off short before I could speak and ask any further.

**"I understand your confusion, Marten, that is only natural. You find yourself in an Elevated Realm, as you are a Ghost. You, much like I am myself, are part of the Temple of Vestia, a commune of Ghosts that have all gone through death and rebirth the same way you're going through it right now."**

I nodded slowly and understandingly. Looking down to my hands, my legs, and the rest of my body, I failed to recognise myself. I had been bedridden and deteriorating for a year now, by body had broken itself down as far as it possibly could before finally giving way, and now suddenly seeing myself in the same state I was in just before my diagnosis, it was surreal. I was still wearing the sleepwear that the hospital provided me every day, and while it was oddly nostalgic seeing my healthy body in the hospital's clothing, it also made me worry about the new future that awaited me. 

*"There's.. no chance for me to just get cancer again, right?"* I asked hesitantly, still feeling in awe to still be alive in one way or another, but worried it would just end prematurely once more. \
**"You are correct."** Vászi began, **"You cannot contract cancer, or any illness, in this elevated realm. The only force that can take your life, is age."** \
I nodded again, thinking to myself while the memories of my past life were still cycling through my mind. I had already come to terms with the fact that I would never be able to meet them again, or tell them about this fantastic miracle that had happened to me. My last message to them would forever remain the same, that I had passed away peacefully at night without pain, that the cancer had finally quit toying around with my body and my mind, and finally freed me from any further pain. I thought back to Miranda, wondering how she would grow into her role of the lead nurse, my other friends who had gone to Myriakos after graduating. But one person that I wish I could've said a proper farewell to, was my dad. After his busy quarter, he finally paved the way to meet me in the hospital, and even gave me a few more visits afterwards, but even knowing that, I wish I could still guard him, even from above.

After giving me a moment to collect my thoughts, to settle in with this new realm, this new life that was granted to me, Vászi held out his hand. His mask was still shining brightly in the hospital lights, and the white mist had gradually evaporated as well. Behind his mask, I knew I could see a warm, confident smile from him. \
I took his hand with full confidence and with open arms, deciding to not take this miracle for granted, and let Vászi guide me to wherever this life would bring me next.

**"Let's guide you to your new home, Marten."**
