| Appointed as Assistant      | There's an enormous workload you have, Doctor. I'll help you out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Talk 1                      | I thought the **ARC** was big, but even Rhodes Island itself dwarfs its size. There's a lot of questions I want answered, yet so little time to ask them..                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Talk 2                      | Are you in the need for coffee, Doctor? I brought a special brew from back home. Originally *Emyrian*, it's the perfect blend between slightly on the darker side, but not being too bitter on the tongue. Of course, I can also make you a standard black coffee..                                                                                                               |
| Talk 3                      | If I'd go back to *Carbine*? In a heartbeat. But that option is no longer there. Instead of dwelling on it, I will use all my strength to instead aid you, Doctor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Talk 4                      | Doctor, I noticed a trend in the operators in Rhodes Island.. are they all *Leremkovi*? No? Interesting.. I'll ask *Olivia* about this sometime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Talk after Promotion 1      | *Olivia* forwarded be some work from Rhine Lab, and it actually made me see some similarities between them and *Carbine*. Maybe even all these lightyears away from each other, things aren't too different.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Talk after Promotion 2      | You hide behind the mask, but I can see even in your eyes what you long to ask me. I will forever long to return to *Lúniks*, but I've adapted to life on *Terra* properly, too. The knowledge I have acquired in my past years are beneficial to the research taking place in Rhodes Island and Rhine Lab. It's a difficult path, but it's one I will walk without looking back. |
| Talk after Trust Increase 1 | You make me wonder, Doctor, is there something you're hiding behind your back? Whether it's Rhodes Island's mission, its relations with the other countries, or the underlying imminence of Catastrophies, I feel like there's something rooted even deeper than that.                                                                                                            |
| Talk after Trust Increase 2 | I wish I'd gotten the opportunity to meet *Kristen*. I recognise a portion of myself in the stories about her that I've been told. A longing dream to reach into space, and see the beauty that lies behind. There's questions that remain unanswered, like what lies behind the *Skypod*, but I'll save you my knowledge. Unless you're into nightmares?                         |
| Talk after Trust Increase 3 | I feel like I've gotten more adjusted to being on land again. It's not only *Kal'tsit* that's helped me adjust, but *Olivia*, *Saria*, and *Muelsyse* have come in touch with me more frequently as well. Even if it's a tough pill to swallow, Rhode Island is starting to become my home too, now.                                                                              |
| Idle                        | ..You're sleeping? I'll handle this pile of papers, Doctor. You can take a deserved break.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Onboard                     | I'm Maria Limáida, aerospace and aeronautical researcher from *Carbine Industries*. I look forward to working together with you, Doctor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Watching Battle Record      | It's a necessary evil. I understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Promotion 1                 | Promotion? I'm glad to hear my work is effective, that means I'm adapting properly to the workflow within Rhodes Island. I'll use this as a new foundation for myself to improve on, for the benefit of everyone else.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Promotion 2                 | Even if the period has been short, the skills attained have been grand. Our ideals match, Doctor, and I will fight alongside you to reach our common goal together. If a similar issue would make an appearance on *Lúniks*, I'm sure our roles would be reversed.                                                                                                                |
| Added to Squad              | I will aid where necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Appointed as Squad Leader   | I've stood here before. Let's go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Maria the Cosmic Weaver (Caster/Specialist)
*// Maria alter: In 2079, after the end of Hammerhead's support for Carbine Industries and the opening of the doors for the Carbine Research Institute in Pahlatlán and Némiskéi, the call of the void in Maria's mind persists. In early 2079, a little before the beginning of the large-scale moving towards Némiskéi, the voice in Maria's mind begins to echo the same words: "Voyage", "Amadnésam", and especially the word "Perceiver". In a journey towards Amadnésam through rain and snow, the original (real) Maria meets Polaris, and subsequently is informed about the Voyage and its mission, only to ultimately reject it, and follow the dream she had been pursuing since her youth: Reaching space and beyond once more.* \
***Maria the Cosmic Weaver** is the result of an alternative ending to that snowy day in Amadnésam. What if Maria had taken Polaris's hand, and in the end, decided to embark on the Voyage and follow this mysterious voice in her mind, and let the sparkles surrounding her hands guide her forward? The mission for Carbine doesn't reach and end, but for Maria, her lifelong dream and mission is exchanged for one that could go even **beyond** the cosmos.*

| Appointed as Assistant      | Even through my absence, your workload has remained the same. I'll lend out a hand to help you, just like old times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Talk 1                      | *Kostek omtáávitlan šansevvet sol léérestemtevvet u atváštšek..* Hm..? Sorry, Doctor, some things never change, I still get lost in thought. It's a saying from an old colleague I used to work with many years ago. "The rocks on the coast are shaped by every wave that it struck", it means, and it's a saying I've carried with me all my life. May I ask, Doctor, what shaped *you*? |
| Talk 2                      | You're asking about my race? I suppose it did become more complex. *Olivia* explained that *Ifrit* is a chimera, or a mix of *Savran* and *Sarkaz* genes. I imagine in my case, it would be a mixture of a *Feline*, *Liberi*, and the same unidentified race *Polaris* is? Maybe a blood test will help find out the exact details..                                                      |
| Talk 3                      | *Polaris* didn't give you a proper answer about what the *Voyage* is? Well.. truth be told, I can't properly explain it myself either. Have you ever had a dream you felt so close to reaching, even if it was physically impossible to reach? It's something akin to that, but also not quite. It's something you simply have to see and experience for yourself.                         |
| Talk after Promotion 1      | The snowy fields of *Ursus* and *Sami* remind me of the journey I took before I embarked on the *Voyage*. When we have time off, shall we go there? Maybe something will bloom from it.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Talk after Promotion 2      | Rhodes Island still has millions of missions to complete, and many more commissions and tasks to accomplish along the way. I know it can get overwhelming at times, Doctor, I've been through it myself enough times to make that conclusion. But you're not alone, we're in a team, after all.                                                                                            |
| Talk after Trust Increase 1 | I don't have wings like those of *Polaris*, nor do I have horns like *Nora* either.

| Talk after Trust Increase 2 | Are there dreams for you that are out of your reach, Doctor? *Polaris* has told me what you've been through, but with her eyes, she can only look, and not accomplish. Maybe if we have a long chat over it, I can try to string the cosmos in your favour. It might be out of my reach, but it can't hurt to try.                                                                         |
| Talk after Trust Increase 3 | Even aboard the *Voyage*, my dream to reach into outer space hasn't diminished at all. It may take longer than I originally anticipated, even with a new lifelong mission and journey for myself, but if there's a promise with myself that I won't ever break, it's that I *will* see the stars up close, no matter when, no matter where.                                                |

| Appointed as Assistant      | I've stood in a similar place before, I know what to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Talk 1                      | You're wondering why my eyes are closed? It's a safety precaution. Opening them could be lethal for you, Doctor. I will not take the risk.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Talk 2                      | You're asking me where my Voyage leads me to? If I could explain, I would, but it'd be impossible to understand for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Talk 3                      | I'm not *Sarkaz*, Doctor, neither am I *Sankta*. I am *Liberi*, even if my appearance and antics may not match their common stereotype.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Talk after Promotion 1      | My left eye? It's an iridescent, luminescent pink, and it allows me to illude whoever I look at. The wings in the corners of your eyes, brushing your cheeks and surely beginning to constrict your breathing? Do you see them, do you feel them? Congratulations, you've fallen for an illusion.                               |
| Talk after Promotion 2      | My right eye? It's plain white, but much more powerful than you'd imagine. Your robe and hood reveal a long, dark history. I've seen *Babel*, I know about *Theresa*, and I see the disruption her death has left behind. Doctor, history is a powerful means of advancing forward. Don't repeat these mistakes that haunt you. |
| Talk after Trust Increase 1 | I see similarities between my beliefs, and those of yours. Is the *Perceiver* the same, or similar to the *Observers*? In the end, the answer may take another century to find, but it's a question to keep in mind along the *Voyage*.                                                                                         |
| Talk after Trust Increase 2 | Body horror? I wouldn't consider it that, but you're not the first to call it such. After all, it's simply an illusion. You learn fast, want to see more?                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Talk after Trust Increase 3 | It bothers me. Opening my eyes allows me to see the history of everything. I've seen every place Rhodes Island has gone to, and thus the rise and fall of *Babel*, even *Kal'tsit* has allowed me to see her past. But yours? I simply cannot. Can you do it verbally?                                                          |
| Idle                        | Your eyes are closed, can you still see me? Worry not, Doctor, I won't leave my post.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Talk 4 (Trust increase 3) | **Maria**                   | By now, you surely must've seen the sparkles around her hands during battle, Doctor. It's not Originium Arts, nor is it Ultima. Instead, it's a more mysterious cosmic power akin to mine. <br>It's something that she'd been granted at birth, a voice that had been haunting her since, a power that had been waking inside her. She'd developed it, and yet, she chose to reject it?<br>I can't wrap my head around it, Doctor. It goes against all I believe, all I live for. Rejecting the Voyage is not a possibility for me, but for *Maria*, maybe things are different..                                                 |
| Talk 5 (Trust increase 3) | **Maria**                   | I spoke with *Maria* earlier, and coincidentally, the Voyage was brought up. I wasn't angry with her, nor was I disappointed in her decision from all these years ago, but I was understanding. <br>I understand it now. The call of the void in her head had quieted down when she made her decision to not embark on the Voyage. She explained she had a dream to pursue, a desire to reach the edges of space, and find answers to her lifelong questions.<br>I respect it, and don't reject her decision. Maybe in another universe, we would have shared the Voyage. But aboard Rhodes Island, we now share another mission. |
| In Battle 1               | **Maria the Cosmic Weaver** | My eyes will guide your strings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Talk 1                    | **Angel**                   | The white *Vulpine* with the spear glued to her hands is one of the projects I once oversaw. But her strength begins to worry me. Had *Francis* gone overboard..?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Talk 2                    | **Angel**                   | It seems the medication on *Angel*'s wrist is effective, the discolouration hasn't spread much further since. Perhaps, Rhodes Islands can elevate her skill ceiling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Talk 1                      | I'm not Siracusan, but I can understand your confusion. After all, the average person wouldn't see the difference between a Siracusan Lupo and myself either.                                           |
| Talk 2                      | The scars on my hands are not the result of Oripathy, but it could be considered as something similar. It grows and crystallises upon use, and doesn't shrink away after. Maybe it *is* Oripathy?       |
| Talk 3                      | If I'm quiet, I'm probably lost in thought. Or I'm tracing the lines on my arm. Think nothing of it.                                                                                                    |
| Talk after Promotion 1      | The crystals on my arm don't hurt, unless pressure is put onto them. It doesn't bleed, but neither does it regress.                                                                                     |
| Talk after Promotion 2      | I've killed plenty of people in my past, often without an underlying reason. But you, Doctor, have given me enough reason to continue to fight.                                                         |
| Talk after Trust Increase 1 | If anything, creating fire at will can be as beneficial as it is bothersome. I won't need to think about feeling cold, but it does come with the risk of burning the landship to the ground.            |
| Talk after Trust Increase 2 | Is *Windbreak* here too? *I miei occhi non mentono*, (My eyes don't lie), I can recognise her from even the furthest of distances. I'll catch up with her once I'm on break.                            |
| Talk after Trust Increase 3 | I often wonder what my life would look like if I never left the *Subterrane*. *Grazie a lei, Doctor, non ho più bisogno di immaginarlo.* (Thanks to you, Doctor, I don't need to imagine that anymore.) |
| Idle                        | Break time? *Ti seguirò*. (I'll follow you.)                                                                                                                                                            |

| Promotion 1                 | The more I learn to work around my *anomaly*, the stronger I can become. *Kal'tsit's* medication is working. I know I can get further.                                                                  |
| Promotion 2                 | My flames curve graciously through the open air, without limits to hold it back. Doctor, *da qui in poi niente potrà più fermarmi.* (From now on nothing can stop me.)                                  |

| Appointed as Assistant      | Don't worry, Doctor, I won't let anyone lay a finger on you.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Talk 1                      | I'm surprised I feel at home on Rhodes Island. Is it because of the similarities with SOLARdawn? Maybe not in terms of ethics, but then again, my *spear* did bleed for the both of them..                                                                          |
| Talk 2                      | I still I see familiar faces even on Rhodes Island, but every time I think I recognise someone, they're already long gone.                                                                                                                                          |
| Talk 3                      | Don't fall for the *False Angel*'s (*Polaris*) tricks. Nothing that comes out of her mouth is genuine. If anything looks surreal or odd to you, I'll personally deal with her.                                                                                      |
| Talk after Promotion 1      | The discolouration on my hand is a side effect from using the *spear* and channelling my flames through it, but so far, it's not something that harms me. In fact, I think it looks relatively cool, don't you agree?                                               |
| Talk after Promotion 2      | My tally grows, and it will forever grow so long I choose to raise and thrust my *spear* forward. Turning back? It's too late for that, Doctor.                                                                                                                     |
| Talk after Trust Increase 1 | You can ask about my past all you want, but I simply remember none of it. Coming to think of it, isn't that similar to what you're experiencing, Doctor?                                                                                                            |
| Talk after Trust Increase 2 | Doctor, do you wonder what happened before you lost your memories? I wonder about mine too, and I constantly get told about the person who I was before I was given the *Flame Heart*. But she's a vastly different person from myself, are they telling the truth? |
| Talk after Trust Increase 3 | Maybe if we put our heads together, we can both figure out each other's pasts. That way, maybe we can learn whether we've advanced or regressed as a person. And that way, we can improve ourselves even further. Say, Doctor, up for a long talk together?         |
| Idle                        | Sweet dreams, Doctor. I won't allow anyone to disturb you.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Onboard                     | As the Angel of SOLARdawn, I serve to protect, judge, and act accordingly. The *bloodstained spear*? It's one of many means of "acting accordingly", Doctor.                                                                                                        |
| Watching Battle Record      | And even after this long, I still learn to improve every day. My fire will burn brighter, until it is no longer necessary.                                                                                                                                          |
| Promotion 1                 | The flame on my *spear*, and the scars on my wrist grow the more I fight. It will burn brighter and brighter, with every passing day. Is there a limit? I hope I won't need to see it.                                                                              |
| Promotion 2                 | You have a dream set in stone, and a burning desire to achieve it no matter what stands in your way. Let me stand in front of you on the way there, Doctor. I've made my choice. I'm not blocking the path, I'm forging it for you.                                 |
| Added to Squad              | Hm? Don't cherry pick for too long, Doctor, I know where to go.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
