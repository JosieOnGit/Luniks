# Questionnaire for Maria Limáida
### Name: 
Maria Eliana Limáida
### Sex: 
Female
### Age: 
42 (Born *August 17th, 2054*)
### Race: 
Human / Feline (Leremkov)
### Physical Appearance: 
Maria is a 172cm tall middle-aged woman. She has relatively dull green eyes, and wavy brown-coloured hair that reaches down to just below her shoulders. Her physical build is healthy enough, but barely so, as she spends most of her time seated or standing doing research work aboard the ARC. Research in Zero-G has affected her physical health, but since 2093, she has almost exclusively stayed on the ground (Although aboard spaceships/space-stations). Her physical build is complimented by the similarly-coloured ears and tail belonging to a *yet-unidentified race* of a cat. She is slightly nearsighted, and wears glasses.
### How does this character feel about their physical appearance? 
Maria is relatively indifferent about her physical appearance, and doesn't bear too much thought to it. However, even over a decade after contracting Leremkov, and gaining the physical traits of a feline, she is still extremely annoyed by these traits specifically. She actively trains her tail to be immobile, and tries to ignore it altogether.
### Describe your character's upbringing (relationships, hobbies, location): 
- **Relationships**: 
	- **Family**: Maria is an only child, born from a **Sirálian** father and a **Jóthuli** mother in **Dazlácé** near **Jóukmandar**. Her parents and her moved to **Liavolta** when she was just two years old, before ultimately moving back to **Jóukmandar** at the age of twelve. She moved out of her home to **Kristensend** to study astronomy and aeronautical science. Despite moving away from her parents, she remained in close contact, while they ultimately went through a divorce. She has no bad blood with her parents. Her father now lives in **Sirália** as President of the **LESD**, while her mother retained a much simpler workfield back home in **Dázlacé**.
	- **Romantic**: Maria is *widowed*, having lost her wife, *Raléi Alentikíles*, in the **Álef-Nórem bombing** in 2075. Ever since, she has vowed and promised to maintain their marriage for the rest of her life, even if it meant moving forward alone, and by herself. 
- **Hobbies**: Although Maria, in 2096, has no time for hobbies at all, she used to adore reading and studying in her younger years. Stargazing was on top of the list, an activity she shared with Raléi, and pursued soon after her death. 
- **Location**: Maria has moved plenty of times in her past. She was born in **Dázlacé** (*Jóthul*), lived in **Liavolta** (*Sirália*), studied in **Kristensend** (*Rhódisz*), lived and worked in **Kósfrii** (*Thórirsant*) and **Álef** (*Zakh'háfo*), and pursued her dreams of aeronautical science and eventual revival of the humanitarian space age in **Némiskei** (*Thórirsant*) after having worked in **Shánzhe** (*Zhuehai*). Ultimately, she now spends most of her time in orbit of Lúniks aboard the **ARC**.
### What is your character's best memory and worst memory? 
- **Best**: Maria's best memory comes from seeing the **ARC** (*Advanced Research for Carbine*), the space station that she had designed, built, and activated from the ground up, finally jump to life. Despite having had involvement in Hammerhead's research programs for space-faring vehicles, the **ARC** was her very own brainchild, and almost immediately after, it became her home.
- **Worst**: Self-explanatory if you've read [[ACT II - ÁLEF AFTER SUNDOWN]]. At the end, Maria can only watch her lifetime partner, wife, and very own star, fall into the abyss in **Álef-Nórem**, never to be seen again.
### How much education has your character had? 
A relatively ridiculous amount of education. While mostly self-taught, Maria studied **Aeronautical Science** in **Kristensend**, as well as having a degree in **Astronomy** which she gained at the **Liavoltan University**. She's had an internship at the Nuclear Reactors of **Kósfrii** in 2073, and has also had an involvement and exposure to the manpower and technology behind the **Nuclear Fusion Reactor**. During her years in **Shánzhe** and **Némiskéi**, she gained a degree in **Aerospace Engineering**, which led to her becoming the head of design behind the majority of **Carbine's Space Fleet**.
### What kind of relationship does your character have with their family? 
As written above, Maria has no bad blood with her father nor mother, even if the two have divorced. She lives by herself on the **ARC** as of 2096, but still keeps frequent contact with her parents, although she usually decides to not return to Lúniks to meet them in person, citing she **"Is far too busy to allow a break"**.
### Does your character have any romance interests? 
As of **2075**, the year her partner *Raléi* died, she has vowed to never take off her ring, and never engage in a romantic relationship with anyone else. Although she is deeply involved in the science behind space, and space-faring aircraft, she firmly believes that once she dies herself, she will be reunited with *Raléi*. 
### Does your character have any moral convictions? 
maria is woke and based if that makes sense.
### Does your character have any religious beliefs? 
Maria is not religious.
### Does your character have any children? 
Maria did not have children with Raléi, as their work at the time simply didn't allow them the space and comfort to adopt a child. Following Raléi's premature death in 2075, the option for Maria to adopt a child disappeared altogether.
### How do they feel about children? 
Even though Maria and Raléi never got the opportunity to, Maria would've loved to have a child of her own, though. At the age of 42, she can be seen (If time allows her) reading to children on request in elementary schools in Némiskéi near the **Carbine Research Institute**. According to her, having children would be a dream she'd love to achieve in a "next life".
### What does your character do for work? 
Maria is:
- Head of the **ARC**. Designer of the **ARC**. 
- Although she has passed down the duties to spread them out under her wings, Maria remains the only person within **Carbine** to bear the title of *"Control"*. Even so, she has only used her rank *once*, doing so to command the **Platinum Halberd** back to **Lumen** in [[Routine Maintenance - ARC ver.]].
- Class 1 *Aerospace Engineer* and *designer* within **Carbine**, sharing this role only with **Thomas Vanhuyt** and **Patrik Miyidkov**. \
In the past, Maria worked for:
- **Álef Metro**: As an intern overseeing the security of the metro underground.
- **Carbine Industries**: As an intern overseeing and working with the **Kósfrii/Jánhul Reactors** for the **Nuclear Fusion Project**, or **"Spider's Web"**.
- **Kristánisin's Agency**: As a weapon's expert.
- **Hammerhead Industries**: As an aeronautical engineer for the up-and-coming **Space Division**.
- **Carbine Research Institute**: As an expert aeronautical engineer and researcher.
### How is their relationship with their boss and co-workers? 
Although Maria is usually considered or seen as the "big boss" or "overseer" of the **ARC**, she has a very level (although distant) relationship with her direct co-workers. Despite being at the very top, she usually doesn't like having this much authority at once, and spreads it out over the rest of her colleagues (Like she does with her Control authority aboard the **ARC**) so she can resume her focus on her own work, which is already draining enough for her.
### Does your character like their job? 
Absolutely, although it may sometimes not come across that way. She struggles pinpointing the answers to her age-old question of **"Is there more out there?"** It's a question that she shared with *Raléi*, and has promised to answer even after her death. This is why she is mostly seen seemingly lost in thought at the café, lost in an endless swarm of papers and documents related to her research to answer this question. Not just for herself, but for the rest of humanity.
### What does your character do for fun? 
Although she rarely has time to do so, Maria still enjoys reading and stargazing in the few moments of time she has off. It may not be seen as "fun" to the average person, but she has taken the **230 - Bronze Dart**, a relatively small spaceship, out for flight away from the **ARC** by herself to simply drift in the vast emptiness of space in orbit of **Lumen**.
### What makes your character excited?
Maria is present for every launch of a newly-developed and produced spaceship, even if she hasn't had an involvement in the development of said spaceship. The first flight of a newly-built spaceship is always a sight to behold, and every single time, no matter how many times she's witnessed the launch of a spaceship before, it gives her goosebumps again and again.
### What does your character fear the most?
One of Maria's strongest fears is that her decades of work in the search for answers to the universe will ultimately end up as nothing more than questions. The **ARC** exists as a means to help bridge humanity closer to the future, and with **Hammerhead** joining the newly revived space race, Maria believes that the answers to her questions, those that are now shared by thousands, if not millions of humans, will finally be answered if many more people join her search. \
Even so, her strongest fear remains that even with hundreds of telescopes, and hundreds of spaceships and stations researching every inch of the galaxy and universe, the answer still won't be found within her lifetime.
### What does your character dislike doing?
Even though it may not come across that way, Maria dislikes addressing a group. Although she frequently held lectures and addressed thousands of people at once during her research in **Shánzhe** for **Hammerhead** during the *Naming proposals for Messier-48*, the deeply-rooted anxiety remained in her mind when speaking for such a large number of people at once. Whenever she *can* avoid it, she'd gladly take that opportunity to do so, but even so she is confident enough to hold lectures if truly necessary.
### What is your character's philosophy on life? 
Maria is a firm believer in the fact that either:
- Humanity is not the only species in the universe that is intelligent, and somewhere out there, another species exists that is either on par with humanity, or more/less advanced than them.
- Even if humanity might not find another species similar to themselves, at least humanity will become a space-faring species that will survive millennia into the far future. This belief is reinforced by the fact that humanity already settled another planet, and the journey as of 2096 leads into terraformation projects of **Mars**, **Dvóniks**, and various moon bases or cities are already in motion.
### Does your character have any political views? 
Maria herself isn't involved too much in politics, as this is a task she passes down to the people within **Carbine** that are much more knowledgeable on these matters. The only political stance that becomes clear within storytelling (**TRAVEL RISK**) is that she firmly believes the "Mafias" of **Máneá** and **Zakh'háfo** have to come to an end, and in the process of achieving this belief, this is where she lost *Raléi* in **Álef**.
### Describe your character's personality (introvert, extrovert, shy, outgoing): 
Maria is relatively introverted and shy at heart, but can be outgoing if absolutely necessary. Although she doesn't prefer to, Maria can work in groups, but much more prefers to work alone by herself, usually in the open (within a café, or someplace similar) or alone in her own office. 
### What emotions does your character feel the most? 
Maria usually comes across as a very neutral person, without much emotions or expressions on display, other than looking tired all the time. Especially during **Routine Maintenance**, she goes through lots of trauma upon the disappearance of both **Alessi Shuttles**, and has to overcome these traumas to fight through the fears, sadness, and endless flood of emotions that have built up from the past in order to rescue whoever is left aboard both of the Shuttles. All in all, to a person who might not know Maria personally, she is usually seen as a person who is "Passionate, but hides a lot of sadness and trauma".
### What are your character's strengths and weaknesses? 
Maria's strengths lie within her knowledge and skills acquired during her many years within the research institutes of **Hammerhead** and **Carbine**, but her weaknesses mostly lie within her mind. She is still actively struggling with her traumas from the past. *// Needs more examples.*
### What is your character proud of? 
Maria's **magnum opus** is the **ARC**, the enormous donut-shaped space station orbiting Lúniks and housing thousands of researchers and providing a safe haven for other space travellers. According to everyone within **Carbine**, and even to those working for other institutes, the **ARC** is considered a "Marvel of engineering". Every spaceship that she has had an involvement in, is a ship she is proud of, but the **100 - Golden Bow** is her proudest work to date. It was the namesake of *Raléi*, and it would honour her wishes and desires that she had before her death, as a means to carry on her legacy. The name of the **100**, **"Golden Bow"**, is also a nod to Raléi, who used to wear a lot of golden rings (Although their marriage ring was made of silver, housing a diamond), and had a deep interest in archery. In **2091**, Maria's **Golden Bow** would go through Lúniks's atmosphere for the very first time, becoming a foundation for the future of **Carbine** and the new space race as a whole.
### What is your character ashamed of? 
Maria is ashamed of her Feline traits, and tends to get annoyed whenever her ears or tail get a mind of their own and act by themselves. Even through she's forced herself and her traits to undergo a decade of training, they still manage to slip through the cracks every now and then, revealing and betraying her emotions when she prefers to keep them hidden.
### Is your character healthy or do they have any ailments?
Apart from being near-sighted, Maria is completely healthy.
### How smart is your character? 
Frequently renowned as the "smartest woman within **Carbine**", Maria's knowledge of space engineering and the understanding of the physics within the observable universe have helped **Carbine** leap forwards in the race to catch up to **Hammerhead**, and together with **Thomas Vanhuyt**, Maria was one of the only people to have such an important role within the construction of the **ARC**.
### What is your character's relationship with the other major characters?
"Other Major Characters" is a broad term. However, her relations with some of the characters are:
- **Cisila Siveta**: Maria doesn't have a direct relation with Cisila, nor with **Gradient**. (*// **Heavy Rainfall Warning** and **ANGEL/A New Dawn** are all stories that are currently in development that might influence the resulting relationship between Cisila (Project VIOLET) and Maria during, or after, **Routine Maintenance**.*)
----
Now that you know how your character functions in their daily life, you need to determine how they will function in your story. 
### Describe your character's story-line in one (two) sentences: 
A desire and a dream that has propelled her through the majority of her lifetime was to reignite the human space race, and discover and answer the lifelong question that humanity has asked itself all these years: "Is there more out there?". Even if the journey there has been met with many hurdles, including the gruesome loss of her partner, and the incidents and disasters she had witnessed first-hand, she is dead-set on pursuing her dreams, and doing so on behalf of her partner awaiting her far above.
### What is your character's motivation (what is their overall desire)? 
Stargazing was a hobby that Maria shared with *Raléi*, her wife that she had lost two decades ago. Her motivation not only comes from the simple dream and desire of answering a question she's asked herself since her childhood, but it's also backed up and pushes her forward whenever **Carbine**, **Hammerhead**, **Moonlight**, or any other industry/company joins the race and journey to discover what's out there beyond the stars.
### What is your character's goal (what do they want)? 
Maria's goal is to answer a lifelong question, which she shares with the majority of her teams in her parallel field of work in astronomy and aeronautical science: "Is there more out there?". She firmly believes that humanity successfully reaching Lúniks all these years back in **2005** was only the beginning of a much larger journey that she herself would kickstart. For *Raléi*, Maria wants to personally reach the **Cintura** system, which was named by her posthumously, and set forth the interstellar journey for humanity. 
### What strength will help your character achieve their goal? 
Maria is extremely talented and knowledgeable in the field of astronomy and spaceship/-station design and functionality. This enormous toolbox of skills within her mind is backed up by the incredible infrastructure that **Carbine** can supply, and ultimately, it has been the main reason that the **ARC**, **Carbine**'s and Maria's magnum opus and most prized station, could be built in the first place.
### What weakness will hold your character back from achieving their goal? 
Maria's introvertedness and shyness of Maria can hold her back in the short term. Especially when it's absolutely necessary for her to address a group, she tends to postpone the date to build up confidence, which she in return fails to gain as well. Next to her personality holding her back, she is also continuously dealing with *trauma* 20 years onwards from the **Álef Crisis** in **2075**, where she lost her wife to the abyss in the destructed metro system. She still has nightmares where she relives the experience again and again, and these traumas are holding her back from thinking properly, which becomes evident in **Routine Maintenance**. Lastly, she contracted *Leremkov* in **2078** while en route to **Kósfrii**, **Thórirsant**, for the installation of the *Kósfrii Domes* following the disaster of the **Spider's Web Project**. Even though she's had almost two decades to adjust to her gained Feline traits, these still disturb her in everyday life aboard the **ARC**.
### What is your character's conflict (what prevents them from achieving their goal)? 
The most apparent struggle that Maria and the rest at **Carbine** will experience becomes evident in **Routine Maintenance**, where the **Alessi Shuttles** vanish off the radar and travel to the **Cintura** system in an emergency. Together with the trauma that Maria experiences, she struggles to properly adapt to the situation and deal with the grimness and reality of the sight before her eyes upon the arrival of herself, her crew, through her ship, to the **Cintura** system. Next to this, the endless workflow that Maria goes through for her work aboard the **ARC** (Managing the **ARC** as *Control*, being present for the launch of new spaceships, but also having a role in the development of new generations of spaceships, and dealing with *Moondial's discovery of cellular life on Oceana* and the *Connection between Cisila (Platinum Halberd) and Gradient (2076)*) becomes too much for her to properly handle and manage at once, which ultimately slows down her research altogether.
### What will your character learn? How will they change? 
Throughout **Routine Maintenance**, Maria faces herself in the mirror, and faces her fears and traumas in the process. While it may not be as easily for her to get adjusted to her Feline traits, she firmly tells herself that she can deal with the imminent trauma from the sight of the damaged and ravaged **Alessi Shuttles** in **Cintura**, and doing so, she decides to take the lead and assume her role of **"Control"** aboard the **100 - Golden Bow**, which is *Raléi*'s namesake, to once and for all overcome her trauma and fear and rescue whoever it may be that's still alive aboard the **Silver Pike** and **Platinum Halberd**.

----
You need to get into the head of your character. You need to know them so well that you will know exactly how they would respond in each situation. You also need to know what they would say, which brings us to dialogue. 
### How articulate is your character? 
Maria is a very articulate person, and during her years within the university, it was a necessity that she spoke in a clear and understandable fashion. This is also where her original dialects and accents, as written below, disappeared over time. 
### Does your character have an accent or speech impediment or alternative dialect? 
Having been raised in both **Jóthul** and **Sirália**, and having been raised with a mother and father from these respective nations, she speaks with a slight accent. Even so, exposure to academies, research institutes, and work in other nations has evened out this accent. Maria is fluent in **English**, **Lúniksan**, **Sirálian dialect** (*Italian*), and **Jóthuli dialect** (*Lúniksan*).
### Does your character use slang or professional lingo?
Maria is a very formal and reserved person, and since her work requires her to use terms that are considered to be relatively "difficult" to understand for the average person, it can be said that she uses professional and formal language first and foremost.

## Additional Questionnaire
*// This interview takes place about two weeks after the events of [[Routine Maintenance - ARC ver.]]. For writing purposes, it's written as an actual interview. The questions and answers are such written as genuinely as possible.* 
### Age?
**42 years young!** 
### Sexuality/sexual preference?
**I've had a lesbian marriage, which reached a premature and abrupt end almost 20 years ago already. Ever sincee, I guess one would call it "Aro-ace"? I've not really put my mind to it since.** 
### Any siblings/only child?
**I'm an only child, but I've had plenty colleagues I consider to be my siblings. Crunching at work with a group helps build tight bonds like those.** 
### Favourite season?
**I've loved winter all my life, it's a shame I rarely have time to return to Lúniks to actually see snow again. At least the snowy peaks in Ellitróómi are easy to see from the ARC.** 
### Gender?
**Female. No small text there.** 
### DOB? 
**August 17th, 2054.** 
### Who were your parents/guardians?
**Both of my parents are still alive, but they've been divorced for a good while by now. My father's name might be a little familiar, being Enzo Limáida, president of the Sirálian LESD. But my mother, Lana Kozatnië, has been relatively "behind the scenes", you could say. She's not in the best state of health for the past years, so she's been doing community service in Dázlacé as a means to kill time. It doesn't earn much, but considering my father and I both have relatively well-earning work, we fund her as much as we can so she can also live as freely and without worries as possible.** 
### Clothing style?
**Nothing special! I've never been too invested fashion, and with how much I've worked the past decades, I haven't had the time for it either, even though I've got the budget for it. Just sweaters and jeans or skirts for me, nothing too fancy.** 
### Favourite food after a break-up?
**I'm lucky to never have needed to discover that! I've never broken up, or been broken up with, but I can absolutely recommend Sirálian food nonetheless!** 
### How many serious relationships have you been in?
**Just one, which bloomed into the most beautiful few years of marriage I had the pleasure of living through. Even if it had a bittersweet and abrupt, unforeseen ending, those memories can't be taken from me.** 
### Nationality? 
**Jóthuli-Sirálian! My father is Sirálian through and through, with my grandparents also being Sirálian, but my mother's Jóthuli, and I have more distant family from Thórirsant and Máneá as well!** 
### What languages do you speak?
**Too many to list, probably! But I've grown up speaking Lúniksan, Sirálian, and I've learned English from early on as well during my first few years of school. From there on I studied in Sirália and properly learned to speak my father's language there, before studying in Rhódisz helped me learn English better. But even with all those, I'm relatively proficient in the regional Jóthuli dialect as well!** 
### Profession/education?
**Oh my, where do I even begin?** *// This will be done later LOL this is too much to list at 11pm* 
### Comfort food?
**A lot of my early college years were filled to the brim with ready-as pasta dishes, because I'd never have the time to cook *and* to get all projects for work and for school done. I'd say that my comfort food would definitely be a good, proper pasta.** 
### Food you hate? 
**Even though Sirália is a Vestian nation, there's a *lot* of Vestian food from the other nations that I can't stand. A lot of dishes from Hédenis are fine, but Monsán and Vao have *really* weird cuisine.** 
### Music taste?
**I tend to listen to jazz a lot! But others mostly catch me listening to something a little more toned or stripped down during working hours. It helps a lot filling up the silence in the room, even though it can be nice sometimes.** 
### Something you do that others call childish?
**I've been told once that chewing gum was relatively childish?** 
### All-time favourite TV show?
**I've not been too fond of watching TV all too much, even in my teen years, nor now, but there were a lot of documentaries about Stephen Hawking that I was truly obsessed with!** 
### All-time favourite movie?
**It might be a little dated, but I still have a soft spot for the original Interstellar movie.** 
### How big is your family? 
**Average-sized? I have a very closed family from Sirália, who have all come from the same region, but on my mother's end of the family tree it branches out a lot throughout Western and Central Ubunia, but even so, I don't think it's all too big compared to other families.** 
### Are you close to any family member in specific?
**Not exactly. Being an only child doesn't help, and being in my 40s also doesn't help too much, but I still have occasional contact with both of my parents.** 
### Any allergies?
**Nothing more but the usual hay fever. Maybe that's why I've been aboard the ARC since its launch!** 
### Are you an emotional person? 
### Do you get angry/lose your temper? 
### What are some of your guilty pleasures? 
### Do you want or have pets? 
### Are you a virgin?
**I don't think any answer I give would be relevant for this interview.** 
### Do you have or want kids? 
### Any tattoos or piercings?
**No piercings but the ones I've had for decades on my ears. I've not touched these Feline ears out of fear either, even though I've gotten used to them, but piercing those seems like an infection waiting to happen. I *do* have a tattoo on the left of my chest, though, just above my breast, which is a tribute to my wife. Having a tattoo of her signature means she'll always be close to my heart.** 
### Favourite Pokémon? 
### Do you like musicals? 
### Do you believe in the supernatural?
**Hard not to! Despite there being a fair few proven studies and theories regarding supernaturalism, my own case hasn't been explained yet, and as a result, I'm not exactly using it often either.** 
### Have you ever seen a dead body? 
**Unfortunately, I've seen plenty enough. More unfortunately, I've been the reason for it, too.** 
### Have you ever had a near death experience? 
**I've survived nine attempted assassinations. That should tell you enough.** 
### Have you ever broken a bone? 
**Surprisingly, only once! I've had a nasty fall off my bicycle when I was eight years old, and broke my wrist as a result. From then in, I've kept my bones in the best shape possible!** 
### What are you like when you're drunk? 
**Sleepy, drowsy, and *extremely* giggly, I've been told.** 
### Have you ever drank underage? 
**Come on, you're asking a Sirálian woman? First sip of wine when I had 14, courtesy of my eldest uncle's own winery.** 
### First thing you do when you wake up? 
### Would you consider yourself popular? 
### How do you like your tea/coffee? 
**I rarely drink tea, but when I do, I love oolong and black teas with a little hint of sugar! The polar opposite is my coffee preferences, I tend to drink it black without any additives, and if I really need to focus, I can easily go through several shots of espresso.** 
### Do you wear glasses or contacts? 
**I've worn glasses all my life. Contacts never suited my eyes right, and I never bothered trying again as I got older.** 
### Do you have a good memory? 
**A colleague from Íszkéde once told me that my memory was akin to one of their native sayings. *"Kostek omtáávitlan šansevvet sol léérestemtevvet u atváštšek."* It roughly translates to "The rocks on the coast are shaped by every wave that it struck", meaning that no matter what washes over me, I will always remember it and be able to name it. On the contrary, my memory has also been considered akin to a goldfish, from time to time!** 
### Do you have any hobbies? 
### How do you spend your free time? 
### When/where are you most comfortable? 
### Are you an introvert or an extrovert? ### Favourite animal? 
### Favourite mythological creature? 
### If your power gets cut while you're at home, how do you spend the time? 
### When someone invites you out but you don't want to go - how do you tell them? 
### Hot shower or cold shower? 
### What type of character in a franchise or piece of media do you tend to get attached to? 
### Side-sleeping or back-sleeping and why? 
### What would an ideal space for you look like? Can be a room or an environment.
