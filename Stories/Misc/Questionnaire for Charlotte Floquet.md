# Questionnaire for Charlotte Floquet
### Name: 
Charlotte Adelaide Floquet
### Sex: 
Female
### Age: 
27 (Born *January 2nd, 2048*)
### Race: 
Vulpine, *despite having no direct relation to the race on Lúniks*.
### Physical Appearance: 
Standing at *176cm* tall (*192cm incl. ears*), her **Vulpine** features are practically impossible to miss, decorating her silhouette in an otherwise natural light brown colour. Completing her face are deep blue eyes, encapsulated by hair that reaches just down to her shoulders. Despite her physique implying otherwise, she is strongly built and can pack a punch if necessary, but her true strength lies in her mind and her ability to use all various means of tools and weapons in any given situation.
### How does this character feel about their physical appearance? 
Frequently under disguise, her “natural” physical appearance is something she isn’t often bothered by. Despite this, her Vulpine features usually limit the amount of disguises she can take on. \
Additionally, while in college in Lëtzebuerg, her Vulpine features were the reason she was easily bullied and made the target of racism and hate.
### Describe your character's upbringing (relationships, hobbies, location): What is your character's best memory and worst memory? 
- **Relationships**:
	- **Family**: Charlotte was born in the outskirts of developmental *Lëtzebuerg* to a human father and Vulpine mother, and while her early years went "as normal", at the age of 13 she began to recognise and take note of disturbances and accidents between her father and mother. Having lived all her life in Lëtzebuerg, she lived together with her parents all her life, but those accidents between her parents continued to disturb her everyday life, and at the age of *17*, she discovered that is was a clear-cut case of domestic violence. Utterly disgusted, she figured that the only way for her father to pay for this was with his life, and in the very same month, she took his life, fleeing from the house since after writing a note to her mom, and ever since, they fell out of contact.
	- **Romantic**: *// Developing: Meeting Miya after the Benson Gala incident in 2075, her heart flutters, and he refuses to leave her mind no matter where she went. Is this the start of something blossoming between the two?*
- **Hobbies**: Charlotte was frequently seen on the *shooting range*, practicing and mastering various rifles and weapons, and scoring at the top of the charts no matter the combination of weapon and target distance. She was soon renowned as a top-class shooter, able to use any weapon at any range. *"Charlotte, you should use your god-eyes for good!"* A frequent at the range suggested her. But instead of staying in the light and joining D'Police Lëtzebuerg, she went into the dark and became a hitwoman.
- **Location**: Charlotte was born in Lëtzebuerg, and had stayed there all her life until her 18th birthday. From that point onwards, she was forced to travel from safehouse to safehouse, finding shelter from the outside world no matter where she went, and she is now frequently travelling throughout Western Europe, wherever her work required her to be.
### How much education has your character had? 
Having graduated at the top of her class due to her precision and eye for detail, she was quickly enrolled into the *Université du Luxembourg* originally studying chemistry, but gradually developing a love and interest for both architecture and engineering. In the end, she was forced to drop out from her university after the murder of her father traced back to her, and ever since, she has been on the run, learning and mastering the basic and advanced necessities of all that comes with being a hitwoman along the way.
### What kind of relationship does your character have with their family? 
None. Having killed her father at *17*, she was forced to fall out of contact with her mother, too. Ever since, the two haven't spoken a single word to one another, despite Charlotte having saved her mother's life. It simply was no longer possible for the two to remain in contact anymore.
### Does your character have any romance interests? 
Yes. After the **Benson Gala murder** on *Somchai Srichaphan*, Charlotte stumbles upon **Miya**, who appears to be in a similar situation that Charlotte herself finds herself in: A lone wolf in the endless circuit of hitmen and bloodshed. Ever since that day, Miya has not left her mind, and over time, she draws the conclusion that she might have been developing feelings for him since.
### Does your character have any moral convictions? 
Not necessarily, she’s relatively naïve. If it’s assigned to her, it must be the right choice.
### Does your character have any religious beliefs? 
No.
### Does your character have any children? 
No.
### How do they feel about children? 
During missions, despite her main mission being to extract or eliminate a target, her priority is avoiding children from seeing it unfold for the worse if necessary.
### What does your character do for work? 
Charlotte is a hitwoman, meaning she ends the lives of others to set forth her own.
### How is their relationship with their boss and co-workers? 
Extremely minimal. She spends the majority of her time alone in isolation in safehouses, and rarely comes in contact with her boss/client outside of receiving/reporting missions. She does not come in contact with co-workers, and almost always, this means a mission has gone awry.
### Does your character like their job? 
Not necessarily, but it’s a means to survive for her. Now that she’s in the circuit, it’s impossible for her to exit.
### What does your character do for fun? 
Before and after missions, she likes to browse through aisles in clothes stores, picking out clothes that she’d love to wear in another life, one where she wouldn’t be *“chained to the system”*, as she’d say herself.
### What makes your character excited? 
In her off time, Charlotte likes baking, and even if it usually is nothing more than small, single-serving cakes and cookies, it’s a small part of her life between all the bloodshed that she still treasures.
### What does your character fear the most? 
Death, as ironic as it may sound for an assassin. A weapon jamming in the heat of the moment, a thread missing and voiding a potential strike, ultimately causing the mission to spiral out of control. Being a perfectionist to the core, losing balance in the patterns is what she fears most.
### What does your character dislike doing? 
The “wind-up” process, as she calls it. It’s the period in which she heats up to a mission, and where she flees from the site after successfully taking the shot. Even if necessary, it’s “a drag” for her to constantly have to keep an eye and ear out to her surroundings when approaching the target.
### What is your character's philosophy on life? 
### Does your character have any political views? 
### Describe your character's personality (introvert, extrovert, shy, outgoing)  
Dealing with nervous and autistic tics, she is mostly introverted. Having gone through school in her early years, her Vulpine traits were the lead reason for her "isolation" during her upbringing, and for this reason, she prefers to work alone to avoid becoming the target for directed hate at her. But even though she prefers to work by herself at all times, meeting Miya was the first time that the idea of a change sparked in her mind.
### What emotions does your character feel the most?
Throughout her first few missions, she feels mostly empty and hollow, only focused on the mission to complete and the safehouse to return to, but after meeting Miya for the first time, her thoughts gradually turn from *“When do I get to go back to the safehouse?”* to *“Would Miya show up again soon?”*
### What are your character's strengths and weaknesses?
Her strength lies with her knowledge about all various means of weaponry necessary to plan out and execute an assassination, and is paired with her skills to adapt quickly to her surroundings, she can navigate smoothly in and out of dire situations. But if absolutely necessary, her weaknesses lie in her physical strength, and despite being able to pack a punch, it’s usually barely enough.
### What is your character proud of? 
Being alive, even if it’s on the back of the murders of others.
### What is your character ashamed of? 
The endless cycle of death she has embarked on. Being a hitwoman is an endless spiral downwards, and without a way for her to leave the circuit unscathed, if even alive, she can only watch herself plummet further down.
### Is your character healthy or do they have any ailments? 
Decorating a chipped tip of her left ear are various scars on her left arm and leg, having been attained during a nasty clash in an earlier mission. Despite these wounds healing well, she still uses ailments to keep the wounds from worsening. Scars aside, she is perfectly physically healthy.
### How smart is your character? 
She can lay out a plan for action with ease, and knows exactly which type of weapon would apply and be suitable for that mission, as well as various approach and escape routes in just under a few minutes. Her drawback, however, is that she can enter tunnel vision this way, and focus too much on a specific layout, unaware that it may not be the best approach at all.
### What is your character's relationship with the other major characters?
*// Subject to change.* \
First starting as what could be interpreted as implied antagonists, the two stumble upon one another during a mission, figuring out that they are both at the same location for an assassination mission, but not sure if they are serving the same client. **“What’s for dinner?”** She asks. *“Irish”*, he replies. **“McKinney?”** She asks, and a simple nod follows from him. While their targets weren’t the same, it still left her eager to learn more about this mysterious, other hitman. He already walks off after checking his watch, but her mind remains wondering. Would there be a next time?

Now that you know how your character functions in their daily life you need to determine how they will function in your story. Describe your character's story-line in one sentence: 
### What is your character's motivation (what is their overall desire)? 
### What is your character's goal (what do they want)? 
### What strength will help your character achieve their goal? 
### What weakness will hold your character back from achieving their goal? 
### What is your character's conflict (what prevents them from achieving their goal)? 
### What will your character learn? How will they change? 

----
You need to get into the head of you character. You need to know them so well that you will know exactly how they would respond in each situation. You also need to know what they would say, which brings us to dialogue. 
### How articulate is your character? 
Charlotte is formal and professional during and around missions, but can quickly and easily break character when a personal topic is brought up.
### Does your character have an accent or speech impediment or alternative dialect? 
Having been raised in and out throughout the Benelux, she picked up multiple languages during her childhood and adolescence, becoming proficient in *German* and *French* while her mother tongue was *Luxembourgish*, developing a neutral accent in *English* along the way.
### Does your character use slang or professional lingo?
As aforementioned, Charlotte uses professional language during her missions and surrounding her missions, and only slips back to less-professional English around her missions and either reverts to her mother tongue when out of a mission or *German*/*French*, depending on the location of her safehouse.

## Additional Questionnaire
*// This questionnaire can be assumed and written as if it were an interview of the character.*
### Age? 
**27.**
### Sexuality/sexual preference? 
**Nothing I'm.. concerned about. It's the last of my worries..** \
*She lets out a quiet sigh.* \
**I suppose I'm just straight.**
### Any siblings/only child? 
**I'm an only child to a broken family. I don't have many close relatives, nor do I consider colleagues to be family either.**
### Favourite season? 
**Winter! Summers get too hot where I used to live, and spring and autumn are usually wet, and I like the snow!**
### Gender? 
**Female.**
### DOB? 
**January second, 2048**
### Who were your parents/guardians? 
**I'd honestly prefer to avoid talking about them, after all..** \
*She raised an eyebrow, meeting eyes with the interviewer, before averting her eyes once more and facing the floor. The question couldn't be avoided.* \
**My father was the prime definition of an *Aaschlach*, rotten to the core, lashing that out on my own mother..** \
*A deep sigh left her lips.*
**"Were" is the right word to use. He's dead, his blood on my hands. I'd saved my mother's life, at the cost of his, and ultimately, my own. My mother did nothing wrong in her life, so in turn, I gave her the majority of my savings to aid her in the next few months to come, and I fled, not having seen her since..**
### Clothing style? 
**With my work, I'm forced to wear whatever attire is necessary for the event at hand, I don't have much freedom in deciding that. But if I could choose, I'd love to wear loose, baggy clothing, something that I'll feel properly comfortable in wherever I go. I don't need to turn heads, I don't need it to be the top of the shelf, as long as I'll feel comfortable in it.**
### Favourite food after a break-up? 
**Ice cream? I've not had a break up, nor a relationship at all, but I've usually had ice cream to console and comfort myself before.**
### How many serious relationships have you been in? 
**None.** \
*The interviewer raised an eyebrow, but Charlotte's face remained stern.* \
**I know..** \
*She sighed deeply.* \
**I don't have time for it in this field of work, maybe I'm destined to be an *Einzelgänger* all my life..**
### Nationality? 
**Lëtzebuergesch! Officially, I'm registered as a resident of the Benelux, but that sounds rather lame, if I'm being honest.**
### What languages do you speak? 
**My native tongue is Luxembourgish, but I'm also fluent in French, German, and English.**
### Profession/education? 
**My work is.. a bit confidential.. But.. I've studied architecture and engineering at the Université du Luxembourg.** \
*"And at what level did you graduate?"* \
**Ah.. awer.. I haven't..**
### Comfort food? 
**Anything that has to do with baking! I love baking, anything from cakes, cookies, to little muffins and everything else, that definitely sparks something inside me!**
### Food you hate? 
**I'm not too much of a picky eater, but onions is where I draw the line!**
### Music taste? 
*A sparkle appeared in her eyes. Did we discover one of her hidden hobbies?* \
**Anything! I listen to rock, I listen to electronic music, to music with loud bass to jazzy tunes, anything, anywhere!** \
*"If you had to pick your favourite artist, who would that be?"* \
**Ooh, that's tough~ I'd probably stick with a small and relatively unknown band called "Professional Porch Pirates, or just PPP. They make some more laid-back rock with influences from jazz, and it's truly a hidden gem in the rough!**
### Something you do that others call childish? 
**I like to carry a small charm with the letter "L" engraved in it, the same letter I have engraved in the ring I have on my left ring finger. It's the only living memory I have of my mother that I carry along with me after I fell out of contact with her, and even if she's still alive, there's no way for me to see her anytime soon, if at all. But, naturally, carrying a charm with a letter engraved in it raises eyebrows, even at work. *"Oh, is that your lover?"* They say. *"Are we invited to the wedding?"* Maybe they're the childish ones..**
### All-time favourite TV show? 

### All-time favourite movie? 
### How big is your family? 
**I haven't ever gotten to know my entire family. My father was German, and had roots in Bayern, while my mother was Belgian. But even so, my grandparents were Máneán, and their parents were French. It's a bit of a mess, and my family is probably enormous, btu maybe it's for the better that I don't know them..**
### Are you close to any family member in specific? 
**..Not exactly. In fact, I don't even know the majority of my family..**
