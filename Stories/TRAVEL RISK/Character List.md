# TRAVEL RISK // CHARACTER LIST
This Character List belongs to [[TRAVEL RISK]].
## Nils Lorieux
Belongs to **The Agency** (Middleman). \
Equipped with neurotech, including **Wrist Rabbit** (Hacking protocol on wrist)
### Appearance
Rough visual reference: **Regis Altare** from **Holostars**.

Nils is a well-built but slim young man. During his training within the Agency, he has opted to exchange his regular casual wear to a more formal type of clothing, wearing a dark blue suit rather than shirts and jeans, to match **Raléi's** outfit too.
### Backstory
Nils's backstory and the course of his life, is available at [[Backstories#Nils]]. \
Nils dies in **September 2076** in **Myrdiva** at the hands of **Angel**, who personally executed him after he and **Nova** acquired and shared information regarding the confidential projects under development in **SOLARdawn**.

## Raléi Alentikíles
Belongs to **The Agency** (Weapons Expert, Owner). \
Equipped with **Stealth Weaponry** (Blade hidden under wrist) and neurotech, including **Wrist Rabbit** (Hacking protocol on wrist) and **Adrenaline surges** (Pulsing streaks on left arm). 
### Appearance
Rough visual reference: **Ouro Kronii** from **Hololive**.

Looks are deceiving, and Raléi knows this. While sharing a similar outfit to **Nils**, a basic navy-blue suit, much more is hidden underneath. Her **Neurotech** was all installed on her left arm, which she accentuated with various tattoos as well, varying from tribal to futuristic and abstract. Having trained in martial arts and having mastered weaponry from melee through marksman rifles, she is a force to be reckoned with.
### Backstory
Raléi's backstory and the course of her life, is available at [[Backstories#Raléi]]. \
Raléi dies in **October 2075** in **Álef-Nórem** after she and **Maria** attempt to escape into Thórirsant after a failed attempt at destroying **Dáritke** from inside out. Unfortunately, the two were one step too late, and Raléi becomes subject to gravity after Dáritke bombs and destroys the majority of the station's halls, burying her underneath concrete, steel, and the remains of a metro.

## Gustavo Dáritke
Belongs to **Dáritke** (Founder, Owner). **Died in 2072** (Rapid decline in health after contracting a mysterious disease)

Rough visual reference: **Michael Andretti**.
## Antoine Rousseau
Belongs to **Dáritke** (Middleman).
## Mika Andzákin
Belongs to **Dáritke** (Robber, Netrunner, Weapons Expert). \
Equipped with various neurotech, including (but not limited to): **Wrist Rabbit** (Hacking protocol on wrist), **Adrenaline boosters** (In heart and legs), **Stealth weaponry** (Blade hidden under wrist), **GHOST Protocol** (On left arm). In addition to this, Mika also has a lot of exposed neurotech, most notably in his left arm, which is accented by sharp chrome and blue lines. 

Rough visual reference: **Mika Melatika (outfit 3)** from **Nijisanji**.
## Katherina "Nova" Mikkë
Belonged to **Vátnelári** (Weapons Expert, broke ties in **December 2075**). \
Equipped with various neurotech, including (but not limited to): **Adrenaline boosters** (Fitted on left arm), **Curious Eye** (Digitalised left eye), which can handle zoom and focus up to 4km in distance, and discolours from her natural blue through to yellow-green the further she looks.
### Appearance
Rough visual reference: **Pozëmka** from **Arknights**.

While still adjusting to her new silhouette, her visit to Cévok and connection to Dominico greatly helped her imminent deafness with the addition of characteristics of an *Arctic Fox*, accentuating her natural white/blonde hair colour. Being left handed, her neurotech is exclusively installed on her left arm and eyes, which glow a bright blue when in use. 
### Backstory
Nova's backstory and the course of her life, is available at [[Backstories#Nova]].
## Maria Limáida
### !! This DESPERATELY requires a rewrite, as it is no longer accurate
*"Of course the public is cruel. They know no better standards, they haven't had the opportunity to."*  
  
Despite not being a strong or well-built person, Maria's strength lay in her extensive knowledge about combat, trading, and everything that has ever entered and exited the borders of Zakh'háfo. Originally from a small village near **Jóukmandar** in western **Jóthul**, she studied in Kristensend in Rhódisz, and eventually began her work in the capital of Zakh'háfo, Ákros. Starting as a junior security officer for the remaining company that kept its eyes on the **Álef Metro**, she was one of the first people to pick out the usual trade routes and meeting points that took place or passed through the various metro stations. From security officer, she gradually became a spy, picking up many stories, many names, and many routes, and supervised herself to dip her toes into the seemingly infinite spider web of illegal trade within Zakh'háfo.  
  
Even without Neurotech, "fear" wasn't a word in her dictionary. The knowledge she had acquired while spying on the various trade routes was enough for her to meddle in perfectly. "Dáritke", "Vátnelári", and "The Agency" weren't mysterious names to her anymore. Despite never having set a step inside any of the agencies, she knew them from inside out, and was only keen on learning more. Trades were happening, plenty of money was being laundered, and plenty of deaths were happening, too. She had no motive, no stance, but her interest kept peaking higher and higher. Whenever she wasn't sure about something, she needed to figure out the details, as soon as she possibly could.  
  
In [[ACT II - ÁLEF AFTER SUNDOWN]], she stumbles upon Raléi, the head of **The Agency**, after making an escape from a Dáritke guard. The two don't ignite a fight, and instead, Maria lays her knowledge of the situation on the table. She wasn't here to fight anyone, and Raléi didn't show hostility either. The two shake hands, and get to know each other more properly.  
  
Maria is very formal, and comes off as a very knowledgeable person. Even though she may not be as expressive as others, she has no cruel intentions or ill faith. As Raléi gets to know more about her, she too, recognises the value Maria would bring upon joining the Agency, especially with her knowledge about Zakh'háfo, and especially Álef. *// This proposal will be worked out on in a later chapter of Álef After Sundown.*

## Mitch O'Well
Belongs to **Dáritke** (Manager (Under owner)). 
## Omáti Honofátis
Belongs to **The Agency** (Middleman, manager). **Died in 2075** in **Ákros** (Exponentially developed disease, similar to **Gustavo**)

# Unorganised
## Polaris 
**Polaris** is **Emily Østengaard**. \
Design reference: **Shiori Novella** (*Hololive*) / **Columbina** (*Genshin Impact*)
### Short history
**2059**: Loses her work at NORCE due to the Oslo Revolution and the increased risk of safety throughout the city, especially within their own research tower. Emily is forced to leave NORCE, and instead settles on what she thought to be a temporary solution until the situation in Oslo would quiet down again. She sets foot to PALMER-EDEN, and resumes her work on neuroscience there. \
**2062**: Having met **Francis Ezarea**, and becoming a good duo together with him in a mixture of neuroscience and surgical methods, the two find themselves once more at the forefront of another war. An attempted expansion of Illinois is met with revolt from the Southern States and Canada, and the already destroyed Chicago is now nothing more than an irradiated dustbowl. Once more, Emily and Francis find themselves in need of something else, and that pathway opens up for them through the institute they already work at: SOLARdawn, a daughter division of PALMER-EDEN that stays undercover and only is known publicly in Máneá as Equinox Medical, opens the Amadnésam campus in the same year, and Emily and Francis see it as their only way forward. \
**2064**: Emily and Francis, bringing along the existing Project CORE, reach and settle on Lúniks in the SOLARdawn campus in Amadnésam. *// Cont.* \
**2067**: Project POLARIS reaches completion, and as a result, the archive in the western wing officially opens. At face value, it is a two-way archive. A section is locked off, which contain highly confidential projects, while the other half is akin to a regular library. \
**2068**: Polaris's rehabilitation period ends, and so does her blindness. Emily is effectively dead, although she lives on within the active memories of Polaris, who *// does not suffer from a split personality as a result. Becoming the Polaris of SOLARdawn had been Emily's wish from the very start, and thus, she is content with her new fate.*
### Project POLARIS
*// Description is due. This will describe her appearance and function in proper detail, as well as her currently uncertain abilities regarding her **eyes**.* \
Drafted is:
- **Pink Eye** (Left eye): *Illusions* (As mentioned in the *infinite archive* that Nevo encounters during [[TEMP - Nevo x Polaris encounter]]), *Basic eyesight* (Although she can already "see" like normal without opening this eye)
- **White Eye** (Right eye): Has many abilities, including *Gathering data and history of data presented to her through any means* (Able to immediately see a history tree of the history of an element. For example, if a used weapon shell is found on the floor, she can not only see where it was fired from, who/what it was fired by, and who the target and its surroundings were), *Neural manipulation* (References: [[ANGEL - Story#Awaken, my Flame]])
- **Sixth Sense**: In her first year after the completion of Project POLARIS, she has kept her eyes closed continuously to not let its powers get out of control. Under guidance of 2C, Francis, and Nadia, she was effectively blind until late **2068**. During this period of blindness, the capabilities of her eyes were also expanded to essentially give her a sixth sense that allowed her to see everything almost normally, forming a vision before her through a mixture of sound, feel, and smell. (As mentioned in [[Internal Channels#Activity log in the Western Wing, monitored by Unit 2C - September 20th, 2076]])
- **Appearance**: Average height (170cm), relatively messy hair with mixed strands of white and black, which curls and goes down to her shoulder blades. Routinely, she keeps her eyes closed, and despite being able to see clear as day regardless, it is done as a precautionary measure. She usually wears formal but thick clothing throughout the year, giving others the impression that she does not feel heat or coldness at all. This outfit usually consists of: *Black (Pink accents) full-length skirt*, *Simple white button-up shirt, decorated by a black (Pink accents) jacket*, completed by a *Black (With pink streaks near the bottom) robe*. Additionally, her appearance can be considered akin to an angel (Unlike the character named "Angel"). She has six small, white wings protruding from the back of her head symmetrically, which are usually seen as nothing more but a cosmetic hair decoration. *// Undocumented, not touched upon: Project POLARIS, and Polaris herself, were originally planned with a ceiling high enough to combat any sort of outside threat that might endanger SOLARdawn's, or Equinox Medical's position within the market and within the world. Especially after the wars in 2035 and 2062 that stained and destroyed PALMER-EDEN's image on Earth, all parties involved made sure that no such thing could happen again. Adding up on her appearance of having angelic-like wings, in a dire need or as an illusionary measure, enormous wings may either appear from her shoulder blades or waist, and while not being functional in any way (Subject to change?), intimidation through this means already suffices.*
- **Personality**: Despite appearing as a bit of a "know-it-all" type of person, she does, in fact, know all. Even so, she spends the majority of her time in her own office, being accompanied by 2C (And eventually OVER_C starting from 2077), or can be seen in the library/archive. Once she does get into a conversation while walking through the hallways, she comes across as a very friendly, genuine, and calm person. Especially to those that only see her as nothing more but a blind person, the sincerity is mutual from both sides. *// Undocumented, not touched upon: Despite this genuine and friendly appearance, Polaris can easily undergo a change of heart when something threatens any project under her wings. "Whoever the intruder may be, the odds that they will remember anything that they have found within the wings of SOLARdawn and under the wings of Polaris are zero percent" (- Note from Francis). As mentioned in [[Internal Channels#Addendum]], the amount of people that have any lasting memory from an interaction with Polaris after having been exposed to her White Eye are essentially zero. (Although this statistic and usage of her White Eye **are** subject to change in this Addendum specifically).*
- **Abilities**: These are currently all unfinished, but as mentioned above: *// cont.*
